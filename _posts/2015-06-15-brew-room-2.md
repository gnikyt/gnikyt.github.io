## Original Brew Room
![Brew Room One](/assets/images/posts/brew-room-1.jpg)

This was my brew room in the basement when I first bought the house. Slightly messy as I was moving, and had some junk in there (like the broken clothes drawer there).

Last weekend I decided to gut it out, clean, and re-organize it! I took out the clothes drawer, added a rasied platform with some 2x4 and plyboard for the empty bottles to rest on and a whole dedicated section for the fermenting carboys.

Beer is now stacked and labeled, wine is now all in racks instead of boxes, bottles all sorted and cleaned. Quite happy with the result! Now I just need more brew...
