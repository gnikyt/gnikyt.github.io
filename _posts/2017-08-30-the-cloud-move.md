Microsoft and Google... the most recognized names in the tech space. They're both giants that provide similar services.

When the "cloud" was on the rise about five years ago, I didn't pay much attention. I had my data on thumb drives, external hard drives, SD cards, you name it... I just didn't see the value. However, the more mobile I became, the more I realized its value. Not only can I access it anywhere, but its also a great additional backup source. So I started dabbling in multiple cloud providers shortly after.

The problem with multiple services doing different things, is I didn't like it. I'm picky and like things centralized, with a provider that just works. I tried many services, eventually settling on Google for my calendar, mail, photos, and data needs since I already had an existing account there since GMail came into the websphere.

## My Ride With Google

For the years I was with Google, I enjoyed it... at the start.

+ Calendar: worked great with many features like timezone support, find-a-time for invitees
+ Google Photos: had nice facial recognition and awareness tagging
+ GMail: was reliable, fast, and always up
+ Hangouts: provided a great way to chat freely with family or co-workers
+ Drive: was fast, easy to use, and synced without issues

However, Google tries too push the envelope on too many things... starting services and shutting them down, closing existing ones without much warning, constantly changing their user interfaces, changing their apps, trying to tell me what emails are important, using a weird IMAP protocol and "labels" which make desktop clients weep in tears.

Also, as my family came more into play, I discovered Google has no support for family in Canada. I couldn't sign the kids up for their own account to give them their own space for Youtube, or see what they we're up to. I had to lie about account ages for them to get an account, which made everything feel disjointed, and took the "family" aspect away that I was looking for.

I've been using the internet since 1998, I'm capable of managing my email, I'm not a baby and with the constant service changes, lack of family support, it all left me with a bad taste. Eventually, I got sick of it... Google just wasn't for me it seemed. 

At the time, data-wise, I had roughly 15GB in photos, 50GB in videos, few hundred megs in documents, and 7GB in emails. Not a huge chunk compared to some people out there.

## Finding Another Provider

Honestly, without much hesitation, I chose Microsoft this year. I knew everything they offered and I knew I could house myself under "one roof". I already made the move away from Mac to Windows software this year anyways, so it seemed fitting. I used my Xbox/Outlook account and started migrating data over.

+ OneDrive: took all my data with ease, their mobile apps work great, and Windows integration is perfect
+ Outlook: just basic email... the way I like it, nothing fancy, but gets the job done
+ Calendar: while lacking online, the Office365 Outlook version is full-featured and highly advanced. Perfect for personal and my work
+ Onedrive Photos/Videos: Took all my data with ease, and had the basic features I was looking for (still missing facial recognition though)

Now, I had data, mail, calendar, entertainment (Live), all handled by one provider for a cheap price. $69 not only gets me a 1TB OneDrive space, but I also get the full suite of Microsoft Office365 - for work, Outlook 365 is worth it alone.

The move was painless, a bit of time to move data over, Microsoft importer handled the rest (such as emails and calendars).

## Bonuses

A great bonus to Microsoft, is it actually has family support! I can see what everyone is doing, from computer usage, to Xbox usage, purchases, and more. I can limit what they see, control what they buy, and basic ensure everything is safe. We can share information with ease as well, whether it be data, photos, events, or emails.

Microsoft also has a great account interface, everything about their user interface is easy to follow. I can quickly get an overview of any purchases, subscriptions, account information, all from a central location - and their visuals are consistent, unlike Google's mess of interfaces.

## Conclusion

Its a strange path when I look back on my journey. From a hardcore Linux user for a decade, who hated Microsoft, to now using solely Microsoft products - times have changed but so has Microsoft as a company as well. They've been a great choice to be with so far and I have not one regret... but hey, that's just my opinion!
