Myself and a fellow developer are proud to release version 2.0 of BridgeWordpress. We have rewritten our two-way phpBB to Wordpress bridge/sync plugin to be compatible with the latest Wordpress and phpBB release.

In short, the plugin offers these seamless syncing options from both sides...

- Registration
- Login
- Password & E-Mail changes
- Logout

It requires the user to simply upload the Wordpress plugin, upload the phpBB plugin, do one file edit, and finally activate and you're ready to go!

> __Bridge WordPress!__ is an innovative new WordPress plugin which provides seamless integration between phpBB forums and WordPress. Whenever your users log in on one script, they are automatically logged in on the other. When new users register on WordPress, they’re created and logged in on phpBB, and vice versa: when they register on phpBB they’re created and logged in on WordPress.
