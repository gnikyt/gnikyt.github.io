				<div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>I've had a history of a bad back and neck, ever since I was a kid. I've seen a chiropractor countless times about my issues. Sitting all day at a desk in my adult years, doesn't help at all to that.</p>
<p>Researching in help for this, besides ergonomics of the workstation, I stumbled upon the Pomodoro method. A small addition to the day, but a big pay off in my health.</p>
<h2 id="whatisapomodoroclock">What is a Pomodoro Clock?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">idea</a> is about sectioning work into timed intervals, typically 25 minutes. After completing an interval of work, you take a 5 minute break. After 4 intervals of work, you take a longer, 15-30 minute break.</p>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>Your brain needs a break, but also your body. As a programmer, you're desk locked most of the time. You need time to decompress, stretch, and realign yourself from time to time.</p>
<p>Sticking to the Pomodoro method, you'll get in a rhythm of doing your work, then having your break, allowing you to get up out of your desk. This can prevent back issues, neck issues, soreness, and burnouts.</p>
<h2 id="pomodoroprogramming">Pomodoro &amp; Programming</h2>
<p>Programmers <em>hate</em> interruptions. A major interruption to a programmer can on-average, take 10-15 minutes to &quot;recover&quot; back into the mindset of the task at hand.</p>
<p>The thing about programming is you're mentally managing connections between systems, files, methods, etc. An interruption can sever those connections instantly and require you to rebuild it before starting work.</p>
<p>Its as if you had 5 books open on a table and you're reading different paragraphs in each book which all relate. You're in the zone connecting all these similar paragraphs of information for research... when suddenly - someone asks you where you bought your backpack. Oops, there goes your train of thought, and you'll sit there looking at those 5 books and no longer have an idea of where you we're.</p>
<p>Its hard to turn tasks of programming work into sections of 25 minutes due to this. When the timer is up, you're <em>supposed</em> to take a 5 minute break, but if you're deep into a task, it could seem like an interruption and distraction. Its <em>really</em> hard.</p>
<h2 id="overcomingadapting">Overcoming &amp; Adapting</h2>
<p>I was skeptical the method would work for me, the thought of stopping when the timer is done just kept a message playing in my head, <em>&quot;this is a bad idea, this is a bad idea,&quot;</em> because I felt this would cause me to lose track of what I was doing and actually hinder my day, not improve it.</p>
<p>But, due to my past and current back/neck issues, I decided to give it a go - rip the bandaid off.</p>
<p>The first few days was hard. Several times the timer would go off and I would say, <em>&quot;one more minute I'll be good,&quot;</em> <em>&quot;one more minute, I'll have the task done,&quot;</em> and guess what... it was never a minute. I got into that deep vibe and before I knew it, hours past and I was sore and my eyes we're tired.</p>
<p>I realized this and decided I have to be more proactive on it. Adapt.</p>
<p>When that timer would go off, I'd take a mental note of my current status and just drop it all, stand up, and walk around... get a coffee... decompress for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Yes, coming back to the work after the break, it took a few minutes to realign, which was frustrating at first, but I knew it was worth it for my health.</p>
<p>Over time (currently a month doing this), realigning surprisingly got easier and easier, I somehow trained myself better coming back to a task.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Its amazing. 5 minute breaks after every task seems small. But the posture of my body, pain, soreness, and mental state, have all been improved by doing these little breaks and timed workloads.</p>
<p>I have time to stand up, walk, stretch, and let my eyes adjust to something besides a glaring LCD panel.</p>
<p>Its a hard adjustment but just try it, commit to it, and try it for a week. It helped me.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>There's phone apps, web apps, desktop apps. You can even buy a physical timer to slap on your desk. Some are bare, some are rich in features.</p>
<p>Personally, I just needed a timer for the work (25 minutes), break (5 minutes), and a long break (15-30 minutes). An addon for my Firefox fit the bill perfect, called <a href="https://github.com/samueljun/tomato-clock">Tomoto Clock</a> which is under active development. It supports the 3 types of timers, with a visual/sound notification, it also keeps stats of your daily usage for tasks and breaks. Its super simple to use.</p>
