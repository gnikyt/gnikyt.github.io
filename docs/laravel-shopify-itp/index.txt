                              Laravel Shopify ITP

   Feb 03, 2021

Background

   [3]Laravel Shopify is a package I started a few years ago which gained
   quite a bit of community traction. It is a full-featured package that
   helps you get up-and-running with developing Shopify apps with Laravel.

   Around 2017, Safari, and later other browsers, began blocking browser
   storage access for third-parties. This includes cookies, session
   storage, local storage, and more. This was called "Intelligent Tracking
   Prevention" (ITP).

   Given Shopify apps load within an iframe inside Shopifyʼs admin panel,
   this means the app inside the iframe is a third-party, thus will be
   blocked from attempting to access storage.

   Once ITP gained traction in the largest market share browser, Chrome,
   Laravel Shopify was immediately flooded with issues of users having
   trouble with their applications... no login session, authentication
   errors, etc.

Solving

   The problem was hard to debug and hard to resolve. It took many
   commits, lots of community input, and various testing methods to get a
   release out which assisted in the issue.

   The solution was to create a flow that tried to handle everything
   smoothly for the app user.
    1. A middleware to check if a cookie called itp exists
    2. If not, redirect full-page to a route to set this itp cookie...
       this creates a first-party cookie since it was not created in an
       iframe
    3. Re-check the existence of the itp cookie. In some cases, since the
       original cookie was created first-party, this re-check passes and
       the app will load
    4. If the re-check fails... display a prompt to try and ask for
       storage access, and set a cookie through Javascript
    5. If the prompt method fails... as a final fallback, we ask the app
       user to manually enable storage access

   In some cases, 1->3 is enough to load the app, but in the majority of
   cases in testing, 1->4 is whatʼs actually happening to initially get
   the app displaying properly.

   The above flow is similar to what Shopifyʼs own Ruby and Koa packages
   are following, which is what I tried to strive for in the latest
   release.

   [4]Step 4

   Step #4 - Asking for storage access

   [5]Step 5

   Step #5 - Asking user to manually enable storage

Alternatives

   Alternatively, you can skip the standard flow and utilize JWT which was
   introduced by a contributor a few released back. Currently, there is no
   wiki page for setting this up, but one is coming!

Conclusion

   ITP is still fairly new and still evolving with differences between
   browsers. The v16.0.0 release of the package will work well for mostly
   everyone, but more work may still need to be done in the future to
   correct some quirks.

   For additional information, see the [6]ITP wiki page on the repository.
   Also, thank you to the community for the assistance and patience during
   this large issue.
