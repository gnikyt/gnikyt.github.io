                              Guts with multisite

   /* Apr 24, 2016 — 2.9KB */

   This is just a quick and proud update that I’ve released a lengthy
   update to [3]Guts which includes multisite abilities. Meaning, you can
   run the same Guts admin interface for multiple domains. It also
   includes a handy concern for enabling multisite support on your
   application.

   Right from the docs is the full details below. Besides that, I’ve
   introduced a CHANGELOG file, multiple fixes, and more tests from the
   [4]multisite pull request. The Gem is now at version 1.1.0 with a
   passing build. As a cool note, because Guts is on [5]rubydoc.info, you
   can open your favorite doc app like [6]Dash, and pull the full
   documentation.

How It Works

   All models for Guts except for Groups, Users, and Sites, have a
   default_scope which scopes the queries to the current domain.

   So using for example, Guts::Content.all will show all content for the
   current domain only.

Getting Started

  Admin Setup

   Open Guts’ dashboard and head to Sites in the sidebar. From here, there
   are two ways to handle your situation…
    1. The current domain is the “default”, you add the extra domains
    2. No current “default”, you add a default domain and the extra
       domains

   In most cases, you’ll use options one and have example.com pointing for
   Guts (meaning you don’t add it in the section of the site), then you’d
   add your secondary domains such as fr.example.com.

  Code Setup

   Open your application_controller.rb file and add include
   Guts::MultisiteConcern.

   This will do two things:
    1. Adds a before_action to set the current site (@current_site) based
       on the domain, which is also usable in your views
    2. Adds a around_action which tells the Site model which site ID we’re
       requesting so the models can be scoped to only show data for the
       current site.

   For more insight into this concern see
   app/concerns/guts/multisite_concern.rb or view the YARD documenation.

Misc. Notes

  “Set as Default” option

   The Set as Default option the in sites section internally means nothing
   to Guts. It simply flags the site a boolean value to determine if
   you’ve set it as the default which you can then use in your application
   (maybe to query it, etc).

  Users & Groups

   Currently, multisite support does not scope users and groups. This
   means the same users and groups will appear in all domains.

  Unscoping

   Because for most models, a default_scope is provided, you may wish to
   remove this scope in some use-cases (such as pulling content from all
   sites, not just the current site). Simply add unscoped to your
   ActiveRecord queries.

# For current site
Guts::Content.where(type: @type)

# For all
Guts::Content.unscoped.where(type: @type)
