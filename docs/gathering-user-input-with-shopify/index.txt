                       Gathering user input with Shopify

   /* Aug 05, 2013 — 4.8KB */

   Shopify includes everything you need to setup an online store,
   including free web-based store building software, unlimited ecommerce
   website hosting, and more. It is a great tool for both users and
   developers. It offers a great API which has libraries for many
   languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, …) and a great back-end for customization
   of a store; templates, snippets, assets and more.

   A few times now, I’ve had to develop private Shopify Apps where the
   client would request the ability to gather custom user-inputted data
   from a product page, which they could see on their order form to
   full-fill. As recently, I developed a Shopify modification which needed
   to do just this, allowing the client to gather dimension data (width,
   length and height) from the customer.

   Shopify currently has no option for letting users add custom fields to
   the product page besides [3]variants which does not offer text input
   and is really not suited for this type of application.

   The solution - it’s simple, Shopify has product properties which you
   can simply modify the the product’s liquid template and add in your
   custom product fields; it will automatically show up on the order form
   when submitted in your Shopify back-end.

   Let’s take this example; like I said above, I recently did this for a
   client where he could capture custom dimensions from a customer. All
   below actions will affect all products in your store. If you wish to
   affect only certain ones you will have to modify the liquid code more
   or use the API. But for example’s sake let’s do it for all products.

   First, we open product.liquid of your current shop’s theme, from here
   find the add cart form which looks similar to the form code below.

<form id="add-item-form" action="/cart/add" method="post">

   Next, we add our property HTML. Shopify looks for input fields which
   contain the name “properties”. Anything inside the braces will be the
   label of what you want to capture; you can change Dimensions to
   something like Size, Hex Color, etc.
Dimensions (W x L)<input type="text" id="dimensions" name="properties[Dimensions
]">

   In the image above (click to enlarge) I’ve added the code just below
   the variant definitions for the product. This is a very basic example
   with no styling, so you may style it how you please later. As you can
   see, I’ve set a name for the customer to see “Dimensions (W x L)” and
   the input which Shopify can see using the __properties __HTML array.
   The cool thing about it is, you can add more than one - even add file
   uploads!

   Next, save the liquid template and view a product you have in your
   store. You should see the dimensions field we just added and it should
   be usable.

   Now that our dimensions input shows up. Let’s go ahead and have it show
   up on the cart page (for when they add it to their cart). Open
   cart.liquid in your current shop’s theme, find a line which contains
   the product’s title for example “{{ item.product.title }}”. Below this,
   we will add the liquid code which will list all of the properties that
   the user has entered, because remember, you can add more than one.
{% raw %}
{% for p in item.properties %}
  {{ p.first }}: {{ p.last }}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}

   This will allow the customer to see what they have entered or uploaded
   as well when they visit their cart page. So go ahead and save the
   template, go back to a product, enter some data into the dimensions
   field we added then add it to your cart. Once added, view your cart and
   you should now see what you entered on the previous page.

   As you can see, on your cart page you can now see what you have
   entered. Again, this is just an example and is completely customizable
   by you in any way. Now go ahead and submit the order, we will view what
   you will see in your Shopify admin dashboard for the order.

   It’s captured and it’s that easy. Now you have an easy way to gather
   the customer’s input on products of your shop. This is only a bare
   example, you can of course, style it, customize the HTML, add
   javascript and validation, and even tack on the captured data to the
   customer’s email order confirmation.

   I hope this tutorial will help others, it seems to be a frequently
   asked question among Shopify users and developers. For more information
