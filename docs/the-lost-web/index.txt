   Late last night while in bed, after the chaos of the kids in the
   evening, I ended up letting my mind wander. My mind unexpectedly
   drifted back through time and landed, of course, on something
   development-focused. Not of today, but my own beginnings in it and the
   journey of growth of the web.

   I started dabbling around the year 2000. Back then, things felt so
   simple eh? You navigated the web through Netscape Navigator or Internet
   Explorer, each with their own JS engine of course, and you edited HTML
   with the lovely inline CSS with tools like Adobe GoLive or Macromedia
   Dreamweaver.

   CGI scripts linked to some Perl, C, Python, or PHP script that patched
   together frontends and backends like duct tape. People used things like
   FormMail, YaBB, WebAdverts, or the hot new items downloaded from
   HotScripts.com

   Deployment? The sacred rite of passage: FTP! Or, if you were lucky,
   some cPanel setup. WYSIWYG hosting services like Geocities, Tripod, and
   Angelfire were /the thing/, oh man, I loved those days! Everyone’s
   website was a masterpiece of art and creativity. Sure, today we might
   call it ugly, but at the time? Those websites were the bees knees.

   Who didn’t love some table-based layouts, the wealth of iframes, tiled
   background images, every color applied to a font imaginable (in Comic
   Sans MS no less), dancing GIFs (and the time-tested construction
   GIFs!), hit counters that were the website’s trophy, pill-shaped
   navigation buttons, marquee text sliding across the screen.

   It was just awesome in looking back on it. You can as well still access
   a lot of those old services, some crawlers have archived Geocities,
   Tripod, and Angelfire websites!

   Communication was another story too. You connected through Usenet
   threads, old-school forums like YaBB, and instant messengers like AIM
   and ICQ or IRC.

   Fast forward to today, and it’s a whole new game. Development has
   evolved rapidly… so fast, you too probably didn’t even register or take
   notice while living through it. The leap from things like FTP to S3,
   shared hosting to VPS, simple scripts to containerized services… just
   wow.

   Now we build apps housed in all these orchestrated systems with load
   balancers, auth layers, caching mechanisms, logging, and interconnected
   services which need to be always up and running. It’s powerful,
   scalable, and polished… but whoa, its definitely different!

   Looking back on that journey, both personal and professional, it is a
   weird feeling, like time that passed on me too quickly to enjoy it
   properly. I went from cobbling together web pages in a bedroom for fun,
   leading to my first young gig, to architecting sophisticated systems,
   and somewhere along the way, I grew just as much as the tech did.

   Last night’s mental wander turned into gift of nostalgia. Sometimes
   reflection sneaks up on you and it leaves you with a kind of
   appreciation you didn’t know you needed, but I sure do miss those days…
   can we go back in time for a bit? I want to stay a little longer.
