   Shopify recently updated their admin panel again and started to display
   the value of theme_version from config/settings_schema.json onto the
   theme listing page. Example (yellow highlight):

   With our setup, all our client themes are connected to Github and every
   release gets tagged a version in SYMVER format.

   Depending on a developer or release manager to manually update
   config/settings_schema.json before releasing is not ideal; even with a
   process guide or release checklist, there is a chance it can be missed.
   We wanted an automated solution to update the theme_version value upon
   a tag being pushed to the master branch.

   We have come up with the following solution
   (.github/workflows/schema_version.yml):
name: Schema version

on:
  create:
    tags: [ v* ]

jobs:
  replacement:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Update settings_schema.json
        run: |
          sed -i 's/"theme_version": ".*"/"theme_version": "'${GITHUB_REF_NAME:1
}'"/g' config/settings_schema.json

      - name: Commit changes
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
        with:
          push: origin HEAD:master
          default_author: github_actions
          message: "Updated settings_schema.json to version {% raw %}'${{ github
.ref_name }}'{% endraw %}"
          add: config/settings_schema.json

   Now, anytime a version tag gets pushed to the master branch, the action
   will do the following:
    1. Confirm the action to only run upon tagging; lines 3-5
    2. Confirm the steps will only run if tagging happened; line 10
    3. Checkout the repository; lines 12-13
    4. Utilize sed to inline-replace the theme_version value to
       ${GITHUB_REF_NAME} (removes the v); line 17
    5. Commit the changes to the schema with a commit message containing
       the version; lines 19-25

   Hopefully this is a helpful starting point for any other developers
   looking to do the same process.
