                         Vuex & Data - Keeping it clean

   Jul 19, 2019

Introduction

   Vuex is a state management library, centralized storage of data for
   your whole application. Itʼs well documented, beautiful, and easy to
   use with Vue. The part I want to talk about today is the data portion.

   I have increasingly seen cases where the data state of Vuex gets
   transformed and represents something more than just plain-old data ;
   thatʼs a problem in the long run.

The Problem

   A simple example...

  Step 1

   An external API request is sent out through an action to get a list of
   books.

  Step 2

   That book data is then sent to the mutation handler where the developer
   would map the data to a model class: const bookCollection =
   books.map(book &ge; new Book(book));.

  Step 3

   This transformed data gets committed to the state afterwards with
   state.books = bookCollection;.

  All-Together

   At first, this seems convenient to the developer, because in any part
   of their code, they can utilize their models such as: const
   authorsNotOnSale = state.books.filter(book &ge;
   !book.isOnSale()).map(book &ge; book.getAuthor()).

   But, what happens when you want to serialize that data to JSON? Store
   it somewhere else outside of Vuex? Such as using a library like
   vuex-persist?

   Youʼll immediately loose all those nice model functions youʼve built
   out and you can not easily restore the state because its more than just
   data at this point.

The Solution

   The proper solution would be to utilize Vuex getters to transform that
   data into something more usable in your application.

   const bookCollection = state &ge; state.books.map(book &ge; new
   Book(book));

   Keep the data clean, lean, and plain. Think of the data this way: can I
   serialize this? If the answer is no, you may need to dig into why.
