          Introduction
        </h2>

        <p>
          I haven't had the time to tweak my desktop in over a year, I've been mostly stuck with the default settings
          of Fedora (GNOME) and slowly tweaked things, before that, a <a href="/i3-plasma-a-solid-match">Plasma/i3
          setup</a> (which was awesome!). I've had a long run of different setups over the last couple of decades...
          AwesomeWM, i3, KDE 2/3, GNOME 2/3/4, XFCE, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using GNOME full-time has been <em>fine</em>, but not <em>great</em>. It is a dependable and well-working
          desktop environment out-of-the-box, but that is as far as that goes
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>With every update, extensions break
          </li>

          <li>Hardly any customization options anymore
          </li>

          <li>Requires too many extensions to change basic settings
          </li>

          <li>It still feels restricted
          </li>

          <li>No proper information is displayed
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For me, I like <strong>key</strong> information and <strong>easy</strong> access to things by both keyboard
          (mainly) and mouse. I'm a little old school in that sense... preferring information to eye candy. The days of
          everyone having CPU graphs, cool Conky configs, panels with functionality, and so on, seem to be a thing of
          the past for many users; which is fine! That is their choice. It just does not suit mine.
        </p>

        <p>
          The workflow GNOME offers, by default, has all those sorts of things very hidden or non-existent.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>No list of open windows
          </li>

          <li>No indication of what desktop you're viewing
          </li>

          <li>No quick access to device settings (Bluetooth, sound, wifi, etc.)
          </li>

          <li>Did I say you need a lot of extensions yet?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I simply miss my old XFCE and GNOME 2 layout of the early 2000s -- the peak of the Linux Desktop, in my
          opinion, something which KDE continues to do with Plasma <em>(I have my preferences with Plasma, but I will
          not get into it for this post)</em>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="trying-with-gnome">
          Trying with GNOME
        </h2>

        <p>
          To achieve an XFCE/GNOME 2 setup, I attempted several ways, which worked out decently well! But, of course,
          required a lot of extensions and a theme.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/assets/images/posts/gnomeshelllook.png"><img alt="Finalized GNOME" src=
          "/assets/images/posts/gnomeshelllook.png"></a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The above screenshot is an example of the resulting setup which has a similar feel to the old layout... two
          panels with proper information.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve this, it required the following extensions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Applications Menu</strong>: To get the application menu as GNOME 2 had
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Clipboard History</strong>: To have a history of clipboard information, like gPaste
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Dash to Panel</strong>: To get the bottom panel with the task list enabled
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Date Menu Formatter</strong>: To be able to format a date how we need
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Disable Workspace Switch Animation</strong>: To disable the slow animations switching workspaces
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Hide Activities Button</strong>: Because Activities is useless
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Order Gnome Shell Extensions</strong>: To be able to order the extensions on the top right of the
            panel
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sound Input & Output Chooser</strong>: To be able to change the sound devices easily
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Vitals</strong>: To show some stats (CPU, fans, memory, net, etc)
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Workspaces Bar</strong>: To show the list of workspaces
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Places Indicator</strong>: To show the Places menu as GNOME 2 had
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          And the following theme is to be downloaded: <a href=
          "https://gitlab.gnome.org/eeshugerman/gnome-shell-theme-default-light/">GNOME Theme Default Light</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          All-in-all, it worked well. But an instant update recently killed a few extensions and I simply got fed up.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I said, GNOME works well out of the box, the second you start tacking on a bulk of extensions to backfill
          some functionality, it breaks down. Not only that, GNOME visually does a great job with the unification of
          applications, dialogs, themes, etc, it's very consistent. It's a shame they took such a radical direction
          away from GNOME 2 which was a tried and true base.
        </p>

          Exploring Alternatives
        </h2>

        <p>
          I decided to give XFCE a whirl again, I haven't used it in maybe 5 or 6 years. With XFCE still being actively
          developed, and pushing for a Wayland implementation in future releases, it seemed like a good avenue. Short
          and sweet result: consistency was hard to get between various applications which affected my workflow, I'll
          skip the details as it's simply an opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, a toss-up between MATE and Cinnamon (which I had not yet tried). My gut told me to try Cinnamon; it is
          very actively developed by the Linux Mint team, and its offered as a spin for Fedora, so I took the plunge
          and installed the meta package through DNF on Fedora for the complete desktop package. To be honest, I did
          not give MATE a real chance (yet), since I found everything I needed with Cinnamon!
        </p>

        <h2 id="cinnamon">
          Cinnamon
        </h2>

        <p>
          Without touching anything on the base Cinnamon install, it was already impressive to me. It has a task list,
          workspace indicators, and menus, and as a bonus, it had a consistent look and a ton of settings! Settings
          that felt familiar, felt like I had some control over my desktop again.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hunkered down for 20 minutes and produced an initial desktop which got me back to my feeling of my old XFCE
          and GNOME 2 desktops:
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/assets/images/posts/cinnamon.png"><img alt="Cinnamon result" src=
          "/assets/images/posts/cinnamon.png"></a>
        </p>

        <p>
          It's everything I need to visually see at the moment (minus some system stats which I had not yet tackled).
          It is also consistent. The Linux Mint team has done a great job to build Cinnamon away from GNOME Shell but
          still provide a consistent look between applications for a bit of a bonus on the eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can fully configure shortcuts, the panels, how I need the file manager to work, my desktop to function,
          etc., and all are done with minimal extensions (called Spices in Cinnamon).
        </p>

        <p>
          Top bar:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Default applications menu</strong>: Tweaked with Fedora logo and label
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Places indicator</strong>: A Spice to add Places menu
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Default DateTime</strong>: With a custom format to add a <code>|</code> (pipe) at the end of the
            time
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Current workspace</strong>: A Spice to show the current workspace name
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Default systray</strong>: Tray and X-Apps, and lastly, a mic toggle (click and keyboard)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Bottom bar:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Default show desktop</strong>: No tweaks
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Default window list</strong>: Minor tweak to the Python code to increase the window name length
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Default workspaces</strong>: No tweaks
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Theming:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Icons</strong>: Papirus
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>GTK/WM theme</strong>: Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Desktop theme</strong>: Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua (but Cinnamon default is nice too!)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Additionally, Mint's <a href=
          "https://linuxmint-developer-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xapps.html">"X-Apps"</a> work well and are
          customizable as I like. As well, Nemo, is much more full featured than Nautilus, it actually shows
          informations and has meaningful settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          All-in-all, I am very happy. Cinnamon for my week of using it is a great, well-thought-out desktop which
          brings back the feeling of nostalgia and control again.
        </p>
