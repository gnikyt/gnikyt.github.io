          Big Fat No

        <p>
          This post is about creating unnecessary problems for yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
          In browsing the various tech and programming feeds I read weekly, I've seen a trend of developers asking
          questions such as:
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't know if its some sort of tech-culture pressure to learn these languages and create microservices
          out-of-the-gate for new projects... but it seems to be becoming more commonly asked.
        </p>

        <p>
          The answer is always <strong>no</strong>. A <em>big fat <strong>no</strong></em>. If you're currently in the
          start of doing this, <strong>turn around</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="the-issue">
          The Issue
        </h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Monolith</strong>: This is when the entirety of your project's business is contained in one piece.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Microservices</strong>: This is when your project's business is split up into multiple pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trend lately seems to be people attempting to write with a microservices-first mindset. Not only that,
          but people are also wanting to write these microservices in Golang, Rust, Erlang, etc, instead of a more
          popular/mature language with a full-featured framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've used/use some of those languages, and while I like them, I would not start with them. Even with adding
          packages to fill gaps, its still not as a smooth of a process as a mature avenue can offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          You end up trying to connect dots yourself, writing a bunch of code to handle the basics a framework already
          provides. In the end, spending a lot of time creating a loose framework rather than writing your project's
          business logic. You then also have to write tests for this new framework, then do this <em>X times</em> over
          for each microservice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some things to consider about if you're thinking about starting with microservices, and
          microservices in less popular languages/frameworks:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Are you writing this project by yourself?
          </li>

          <li>Are you writing this project with a team?
          </li>

          <li>Does your team have experience with microservices?
          </li>

          <li>Does your team have experience with the language(s)?
          </li>

          <li>Do they have time to learn it?
          </li>

          <li>How will you deploy the project and microservices?
          </li>

          <li>How do you plan to manage the project's resources?
          </li>

          <li>Are you having authentication and validation?
          </li>

          <li>How do you plan to manage the above if yes?
          </li>

          <li>How do you plan to monitor and log the project?
          </li>

          <li>Are you touching a cache or database?
          </li>

          <li>How do you plan to manage those connections?
          </li>

          <li>How do you plan to test?
          </li>

          <li>How do you plan to write tests between the microservices?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The list goes on and on... starting with a monolith, with a well-matured ecosystem, can handle most (if not
          all) of that list for you. So that's where you should begin. Let yourself, and your team, write the business
          logic and focus on the project's goals itself, rather than trying to manage all sort of separated services in
          various languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will regret it once you go down the path of microservices to start, then your deadline looms over your
          head and you and your team are still patching together the basics a framework would've provided to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You and your team will be able to develop at a much higher rate of speed with the proper initial setup. That
          initial setup should not include microservices.
        </p>

        <h2 id="a-good-process">
          A Good Process
        </h2>

        <p>
          Build a monolith to start. Don't worry about your <em>imaginary server load</em>, <em>mystical scaling
          needs</em>, and whatever nonsense you've read on some clickbait article.
        </p>

        <p>
          Worry about it when the time comes to worry about it - you will know when you reach that point. Also, most
          things never reach that point for many new company projects. Most end up with short lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          What you want to do is keep your core as a monolith and separate your external resources... like database,
          caching, queue, logging, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your project requires Postgres for a database, Redis for a cache layer, RabbitMQ or Redis or a queue hold
          pen, and logging... then those are items you should separate from your app. Allow them to run in another
          instance, either self-managed or preferably managed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This way you have a good base.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Happen to get some hard-hitting load on your app? Throw it behind a load balancer...
          </li>

          <li>Is your database getting hammered? Scale its resources...
          </li>

          <li>Is your cache growing too much? Increase it and create a cluster...
          </li>

          <li>Is your queue overworked? Spin up new instances...
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All this can be handled easily, and with services that DigitalOcean, Azure, Heroku, AWS, and many others
          provide, it can happen with a click of a button... all without the need to microservice the core of your
          project.
        </p>

        <p>
          When your core project is forecasted to approch it's scaling limits, this is when you need to think about
          microservices, but not before.
