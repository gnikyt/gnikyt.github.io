          Preamble
        </h2>

        <p>
          You might think, <em>“Why are you trying to develop on Windows? Why not use OSX or (insert Linux
          distro)”</em>. Its because I’m preparing for a stable future. With the decisions of Apple the past year with
          the iPhone and new Macbook, I no longer like the direction the company is taking. I won’t go into depth, but
          the entire lineup is a laughing stock, to be honest. I will no longer be continuing with Apple for my next
          upgrades.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>I decided to run an experiment to see if I could survive on Windows for my development
          needs.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-windows">
          Why Windows
        </h2>

        <p>
          I used Linux on/off for close to 15 years now. Don’t get me wrong, I <strong>love</strong> Linux, I always
          will. I don’t care how many people say otherwise, its software support for many apps lacks compared to the
          Windows/Mac version. Many people will say, <em>“So switch to using (insert some different standard or app not
          many people use)”</em>, its not that easy especially in the business world. I can’t just tell all my
          co-workers to start using random apps that have little backing. There’s a suite of software I require daily
          which many do not work or lack proper implementation in Linux… and I’m not talking about the Adobe suite.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apps in Windows normally get the first-class implementation — it just works. This is something important to
          me. I don’t want to fix issues daily, I want to work. With OSX out of the picture, Windows was the next best
          thing for me that would <em>just work</em> and keep me <em>productive</em> in my mind.
        </p>

          experience I could get out of Windows if I used a proper Windows laptop for work (XPS, Thinkpad, etc). I’ll
          note more later why I say I did not get a proper experience.</em>

          Virtual Machining
        </h3>

        <p>
          Development on Windows is a mess. If anyone’s ever done Ruby, Python, etc, development on a Windows machine,
          it’s usually a hit or miss. You run into issues with libs, compiling, support, mystic errors, and a pile of
          workarounds. A lot of people try to get around some issues by using tools like <strong><a href=
          "https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a></strong>, or some other shell implementation but they still run into
          issues. I wanted to avoid all these issues by essentially taking Windows out of the equation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To do this, I decided to run Linux in a VM and host all my development needs in the VM. Now I have a clear
          separation. I can have the stability of Windows with all my required apps, and have my development… both in
          their worlds.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to use <strong>VMWare Player</strong> and install <strong><a href=
          "https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS</a></strong>. I chose Ubuntu over something
          like Arch simply for the time-sake of my experiment. From what I read, Ubuntu and VMWare have perfect support
          for one another. I require no desktop experience… simply a VM I can “talk” to, so something minimal like the
          Ubuntu Server was a good fit. I chose the fast install offered by VMWare Player and I had a working VM within
          5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4 id="performance">
          Performance
        </h4>

        <p>
          Initially, I assumed this would eat a lot of my resources. I was wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          Post-boot, just idling, VMWare Player and the VM instance itself totaled to ~45mb of RAM in-use. The CPU was
          negligible as well. Even during an intensive process in the VM, the CPU only reached 21% and RAM didn’t
          increase by much.
        </p>

        <p>
          So my system was chugging along happily, the VM didn’t seem to affect my computer’s performance one bit from
          what I could tell.
        </p>

        <h3 id="vm-communication-ssh">
          VM Communication & SSH
        </h3>

        <p>
          I did not want to use the windowed experience of VMWare. I decided I just need to SSH into the VM itself. I
          enabled <strong>bridged networking</strong> mode in VMWare. This gave the VM its own LAN IP address. For
          example, if my MacBook was 192.168.2.11 my VM could be assigned 192.168.2.13. I installed an SSH server on
          the VM and set it up to work for my needs. I now had a way to talk to the VM.
        </p>

        <h4 id="choosing-a-ssh-client">
          Choosing a SSH client
        </h4>

        <p>
          I regularly SSH into servers during my week to perform tasks, I also needed to (obviously) SSH into my VM. I
          looked over many options for Windows… <strong><a href=
          "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a></strong>, <strong><a href=
          "http://kitty.9bis.net/">Kitty</a></strong> (fork of Putty), <strong><a href=
          "http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a></strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found Putty/Kitty to be great for customizations… its fully-loaded, although confusing interface, provides
          all anyone could need. It however lacked a single-window/tabbed mode or sub-connections as far as I could
          tell.
        </p>

        <p>
          MobaXterm, although great, I found it to be a bit of bloat… I need a terminal and nothing else. It seemed
          geared towards a more full-featured implementation with support for X11 apps, FTP, text editing, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end… I landed on <strong><a href="http://smartty.sysprogs.com/">SmarTTY</a></strong>. An app I
          discovered while surfing Reddit for suggestions. It provided me with good configuration options, tabbed
          interface, sub-connections, lightweight, and more.
        </p>

        <h4 id="testing-connections">
          Testing Connections
        </h4>

        <p>
          I created an SSH key on the Windows side using Putty’s keygen. I plugged the SSH key into the VM and fired up
          SmarTTY. I created a connection using my username, key file, and the VM’s IP address.
        </p>

        <p>
          It connected perfectly. I ran 4 sub-connections to the VM without issue. There was no lag in typing and input
          to the VM, I was pleased.
        </p>

        <h2 id="post-setup">
          Post Setup
        </h2>

        <p>
          So I now had a working, communicable, VM to host my development needs. I went ahead and set up all the tools
          I needed in the VM (RVM, Python, Go, MySQL, SQLite, Node, etc). On the Windows side I installed <a href=
          "http://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>/<a href=
          "http://www.sql-workbench.net/">SQL Workbench</a>, <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>, and other tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Workflow-wise — I’m happy. I’d edit my files in Atom, have my sessions opened in SmarTTY watching files (for
          Grunt or Rails, etc), edit my databases with workbench. Everything seemed to work fine without a hitch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the setup took a bit time, I believe its a great path to take given Bash for Windows, is not fully
          ready yet for use. I actually, surprisingly found the Windows install to be snappier than OSX… I suspect
          that’s due to it being a new install, however. The battery-life was on-par with OSX despite what I heard
          online of Windows draining MacBook batteries in no-time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall I was happy with the Windows experience as a whole. Both as a developer and a PC user.
        </p>

        <h3 id="misc.-issues">
          Misc. Issues
        </h3>

        <p>
          Although the setup was fine, I was slightly hindered by not using a laptop designed for Windows in mind as I
          mentioned previously.
        </p>

        <h4 id="keyboard">
          1. Keyboard
        </h4>

        <p>
          A few text-flow issues I ran into that I normally do on Mac such as deleting a whole line of text was not
          possible because the MacBook keyboard is missing a few keys for this that Windows targets.
        </p>

        <p>
          The position of the CTRL button was also slightly farther away than I liked. I found I had to change my
          natural posture for using CTRL functions due to the spacing for cutting, copying, pasting, etc.
        </p>

        <h4 id="mouse-trackpad">
          2. Mouse & Trackpad
        </h4>

        <p>
          Bootcamp installs drivers to emulate the trackpad a mouse. Tap emulates a click, two-finger emulates a
          right-click, and there are no trackpad gestures like dragging built-in. Changing the sensitivity of the
          scrolling with the trackpad would result in the mouse having the same scrolling sensitivity and one would be
          slower than the other. I found a great app to get around the issue, called <strong><a href=
          "http://eithermouse.com">EitherMouse</a></strong>. It detects individual devices and allows you to assign
          settings for each. This solved my issue on that part.
        </p>

        <p>
          I suspect if I owned a Thinkpad, XPS, Zenbook, or some other Windows-designed laptop, I would have a much
          better experience.
        </p>

        <h3 id="verdict">
          Verdict
        </h3>

        <p>
          I’ll have my current MacBook and iPhone for a couple of years to come but my next upgrade in the future will
          move away from this company. This experience was a good lesson that yes, I can develop in Windows just fine,
          without any drawbacks that I can see to my flow. This will heavily weigh my decision for purchases in the
          future.
