                          Setting up Lumen with Redis

   /* Nov 19, 2017 — 1.2KB */

   This is more of an extension of my previous post "Setting Up Lumen +
   Mail". I wanted to take it a step further and show the basic setup for
   getting Redis to work, so you can queue not only mail, but jobs.

   First, run composer require illuminate/redis:5.5 to grab the Redis
   components.

   Next, open app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php and add the following
   to the register method:
<?php
// ...

// Configs
$this->app->configure(ʼdatabaseʼ);

// Enable queues
$this->app->make(ʼqueueʼ);

   Next, create config/database.php and add the following:
<?php

return [
  ʼredisʼ &ge; [
    ʼclientʼ &ge; ʼpredisʼ,
    ʼdefaultʼ &ge; [
      ʼhostʼ &ge; env(ʼREDIS_HOSTʼ, ʼ127.0.0.1ʼ),
      ʼpasswordʼ &ge; env(ʼREDIS_PASSWORDʼ, null),
      ʼportʼ &ge; env(ʼREDIS_PORTʼ, 6379),
      ʼdatabaseʼ &ge; 0
    ]
  ]
];


   Donʼt forget to set up all your environment variables for Redis, as
   well, to enable Redis for job processing and cache, set the following
   environment variables:
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_DRIVER=redis

   Thatʼs it! You can now queue mail or process jobs.
