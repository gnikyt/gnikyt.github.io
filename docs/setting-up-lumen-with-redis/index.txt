   This is more of an extension of my previous post “Setting Up Lumen +
   Mail”. I wanted to take it a step further and show the basic setup for
   getting Redis to work, so you can queue not only mail, but jobs.

   First, run composer require illuminate/redis:5.5 to grab the Redis
   components.

   Next, open app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php and add the following
   to the register method:
<?php
// ...

// Configs
$this->app->configure('database');

// Enable queues
$this->app->make('queue');

   Next, create config/database.php and add the following:
<?php

return [
  'redis' => [
    'client' => 'predis',
    'default' => [
      'host' => env('REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
      'password' => env('REDIS_PASSWORD', null),
      'port' => env('REDIS_PORT', 6379),
      'database' => 0
    ]
  ]
];

   Don’t forget to set up all your environment variables for Redis, as
   well, to enable Redis for job processing and cache, set the following
   environment variables:
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_DRIVER=redis

   That’s it! You can now queue mail or process jobs.
