          The journey of running an agency is an uphill one for sure. It takes everyone working together across the
          board, to not only keep the machine oiled and running, but to also produce dependable products to be proud
          of, and something dependable for the clients that use it. Its taken years of hard work to get to the place we
          are today, from everyone involved. Truly a great team and partners.

          Myself, Erik, and Riz of Little Rocket, are excited for our company's future...
        </p>

        <p>
          This morning, LFL Group, who is comprised of the largest retailers in Canada... companies such as <a href=
          "https://leons.ca/">Leon's Furniture</a>, <a href="https://www.thebrick.com/">The Brick</a>, <a href=
          "https://furniture.ca/">Furniture.ca</a>, and others &amp;mdash; also a fantastic long term client of ours
          for years, has announced a Joint Venture with us!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a great milestone not only for my personal goals, but business as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started out almost a decade ago as a couple of fellas crammed into a small noisy cubical space in downtown
          Toronto, in midst of a growingly competitive market, with brick and mortar clients; we grew in size,
          restructured our ways, reorganized our methods, fine tuned our setup; survived through not only the regular
          struggles, but during covid as well when many of our clients had to shut down and pause services. We made it
          through, and lifted up. Its been an indescribable great experience to be a part of what Little Rocket has
          grown to become today.
        </p>

        <p>
          This partnership will bolster growth/reach on both sides and gives us the ability to do continue doing what
          we do best - craft dependable solutions and products for our clients' needs, and our new partners, LFL. LFL &
          Little Rocket ðŸš€
