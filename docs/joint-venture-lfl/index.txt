                             Joint Venture with LFL

JV

   The journey of running an agency is an uphill one for sure. It takes
   everyone working together across the board, to not only keep the
   machine oiled and running, but to also produce dependable products to
   be proud of, and something dependable for the clients that use it. Its
   taken years of hard work to get to the place we are today, from
   everyone involved. Truly a great team and partners.

   Myself, Erik, and Riz of Little Rocket, are excited for our companyÊ¼s
   future...

   This morning, LFL Group, who is comprised of the largest retailers in
   Canada... companies such as [3]LeonÊ¼s Furniture, [4]The Brick,
   [5]Furniture.ca, and others &mdash; also a fantastic long term client
   of ours for years, has announced a Joint Venture with us!

   This is a great milestone not only for my personal goals, but business
   as well.

   We started out almost a decade ago as a couple of fellas crammed into a
   small noisy cubical space in downtown Toronto, in midst of a growingly
   competitive market, with brick and mortar clients; we grew in size,
   restructured our ways, reorganized our methods, fine tuned our setup;
   survived through not only the regular struggles, but during covid as
   well when many of our clients had to shut down and pause services. We
   made it through, and lifted up. Its been an indescribable great
   experience to be a part of what Little Rocket has grown to become
   today.

   This partnership will bolster growth/reach on both sides and gives us
   the ability to do continue doing what we do best - craft dependable
   solutions and products for our clientsÊ¼ needs, and our new partners,
   LFL. LFL & Little Rocket ðŸš€
