   [6]shopify_app is a great Gem to quickly build a Shopify App with
   Rails. It handles all the verifications, authorizations, webhook, and
   more; leaving you to focus on developing your app. This post is to
   serve as a quick tip on how to unit-test your app with the Gem.

   Other than the install page, most likely your app will require a shop
   to be logged in for all routes. shopify_app, upon installation will
   create a fixture file in test/fixtures/shops.yml of your Rails
   application.

   Inspecting it you will see it’s filled with one shop,
   regular-shop.myshopify.com, and a simple token. When running bundle
   exec rake test (after migrations are done for a test environment of
   course), it will populate the shop database table with the fixture data
   in shop.yml.

   Now that we have a shop we can “log into”, let’s create a support
   module for the unit tests. Create a file called
   shopify_session_support.rb inside test/support.
# test/support/shopify_session_support.rb
module ShopifySessionSupport
  # Make this module concernable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    # On include, tell TestCase to use this setup block
    setup do
      # Set the shop to the test shop from fixtures
      # The key is `:shopify` and `:shopify_domain` which shopify_app needs
      # See: https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/blob/c7e50247a72a52b1d1e4d90
09ba997196a64e7e8/lib/shopify_app/login_protection.rb#L22
      session[:shopify]        = shops(:regular_shop).id
      session[:shopify_domain] = shops(:regular_shop).shopify_domain
    end
  end
end

   Next, include your new support module in test_helper.rb before class
   ActiveSupport::TestCase with:
# Include support modules
Dir[Rails.root.join('test/support/**/*.rb')].each { |f| require f }

   Finally, in any of your controller tests where you require an
   authenticated shop, simply add include ShopifySessionSupport to your
   class as such:
# ...
class ImageControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  include ShopifySessionSupport
  # ...
end

   Running bundle exec rake test should now pass your tests with the shop.
