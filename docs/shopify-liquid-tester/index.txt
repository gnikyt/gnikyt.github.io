                             Shopify Liquid Tester

   /* Nov 20, 2022 — 3.8KB */

Introduction

   Shopifyʼs theme system currently lacks the ability to define custom
   "functions". As a result, many Shopify developers use Liquid snippets
   to accept inputs and echo an output result, to create a pseudo-function
   within Shopify.

   A very basic example:
{%- raw -%}
# snippets/fn-remove-prefix.liquid
{%- comment -%}
  Removes tag prefix.

  Parameters:
    tag, string, required: Tag string to remove prefix on.

  Syntax:
    {%- render ʼfn-remove-prefixʼ, tag: [string] -%}

  Example:
    {%- render ʼfn-remove-prefixʼ, tag: ʼType:Cannabisʼ -%}

  Output:
    Cannabis
{%- endcomment -%}
{%- liquid
  echo tag | split: ʼ:ʼ | last
-%}
{% endraw %}

   For such a small "function", no one would second guess, however,
   working with merchant data is sometimes a challenge... What if there is
   multiple : in the tag string? What if we need the resulting value
   converted to something else, consistently?

   We can not unit test Liquid files in the context of a Shopify store
   very easily, which is why I developed a handly tool called
   [3]liquid-fn-tester to assist with this for our clients.

How it works

   The tool works by injecting a custom page into your Shopify store and
   also injecting your snippet to test into the Shopify theme.

   Then, for each test assertion, it then will inject a custom page
   template with your Liquid and reference your snippet.

   From here, the page content is fetched with no layout to get the
   result, for which the result is then used to test for expected output.

    Questions

   Why a new page for each test assertion?

   Shopify caches page content since last year. By creating a new page for
   every test assertion, we can get around the issue of having stale/wrong
   output. Upon completion of the test suite, all created page templates
   on the theme are removed as part of cleanup.

   How flexible is this?

   You extend the base test class which does all the heavy lifting. You
   have freedom to define setup, teardown, and tap into various events
   documented in the repositoryʼs README to further customize your tests.

   Why NodeJS?

   Previously, I had attempted a similar setup with Ruby, since Shopifyʼs
   Liquid library is a Ruby package (Gem).

   While the implementation worked great, it had flaws of not being able
   to utilize Shopify data or Shopifyʼs custom Liquid filters such as
   asseturl, imgtag
   , money, etc. which could lead to some snippets not producing a true
   result to what it would on Shopifyʼs servers.

   Given the process to get a result of the snippet rendering, the tool
   really couldʼve been developed in any language such as Go, or Python,
   etc. however, given majority of Shopify developers most likely know
   their way around Javascript, then it made sense to go down that path.

Utilization

   Similarly stated in the README of the repository, if you place your
   Liquid function snippet into the tests directory, with a defined test
   suite to match, you will be able to unit test the result of the
   snippet. Because its executed on the Shopify store, the snippet you
   wish to test will have access to everything for Shopifyʼs Liquid and
   the store itself; such as request, allproducts, | asseturl
   , etc.

   Your test suite will have full control over setup, snippet
   initilization, teardown, output, and more.

   The repositoryʼs [4]provided examples is a great guide for how
   everything comes together and how you can test a single snippet against
   multiple values.

   Hopefully this tool will continue to grow and is helpful to those who
   are looking to try and test their snippets; both small and complex.
