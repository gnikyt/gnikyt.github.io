                               PHPMailer contrib

   Feb 09, 2014

   I and a fellow developer were working on updating a two/three-year-old
   plugin we developed for WordPress this week. Its a fairly complex
   plugin which is one of its functions relies on getting the recipients
   of e-mails sent out by WordPress.

   During our upgrading of the code, we discovered [3]PHPMailer (the
   component WordPress uses for mailing [4]wpmail, has been changed since
   we last wrote the plugin. The class properties "to", "bcc", "cc",
   "ReplyTo", and "all
   recipients" of PHPMailer went from public to protected over the last
   couple years.

   So our issue was $mailer->to simply wouldnʼt work anymore, and there
   appeared to be no public access methods to get the addresses such as
   $mailer->getToAddresses().

   I addressed the issue on PHPMailerʼs Github page, and [5]provided a
   pull request which has been merged into the master :) So in short, you
   can now access "to", "bcc", "cc", "ReplyTo", and "all_recipients" by
   using getToAddresses(), getBccAddresses(), getCcAddresses(),
   getReplyToAddresses() and getAllRecipientAddresses().
