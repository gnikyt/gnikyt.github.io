   I and a fellow developer were working on updating a two/three-year-old
   plugin we developed for WordPress this week. Its a fairly complex
   plugin which is one of its functions relies on getting the recipients
   of e-mails sent out by WordPress.

   During our upgrading of the code, we discovered [3]PHPMailer (the
   component WordPress uses for mailing [4]wp_mail, has been changed since
   we last wrote the plugin. The class properties “to”, “bcc”, “cc”,
   “ReplyTo”, and “all_recipients” of PHPMailer went from public to
   protected over the last couple years.

   So our issue was $mailer->to simply wouldn’t work anymore, and there
   appeared to be no public access methods to get the addresses such as
   $mailer->getToAddresses().

   I addressed the issue on PHPMailer’s Github page, and [5]provided a
   pull request which has been merged into the master :) So in short, you
   can now access “to”, “bcc”, “cc”, “ReplyTo”, and “all_recipients” by
   using getToAddresses(), getBccAddresses(), getCcAddresses(),
   getReplyToAddresses() and getAllRecipientAddresses().
