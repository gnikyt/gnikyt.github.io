                          Introducing Laravel Shopify

   Aug 09, 2017

Background

   As an active Ruby (and Rails) developer, I found myself regularly
   making Shopify apps in Rails and Sinatra. Iʼve even released my own
   Gems to solve common (small) issues Iʼve faced developing for these
   platforms.

   PHP itself... I havenʼt been active in years on that front. With PHP7
   however, the language is shaping up. It doesnʼt have the great method
   chaining or syntax beauty that Ruby does, but its a well tested,
   proven, and mature language to work with thatʼs easily deployable to a
   magnitude of places without much interaction.

   Being out of the PHP game for a while, I decided to survey the
   landscape. I used to work heavily with Symfony, however, it always left
   a sour taste in my mouth. Symfony is great... its really well
   structured, enterprise type of framework. It falls short for
   medium-sized projects due to the verbosity of it (in my personal
   experience).

   After some digging, I stumbled upon Laravel. Laravel, like many
   projects, uses bits of Symfonyʼs core and builds on top of it. I spent
   a lot of time studying Laravel, its community, its activeness, its
   code. It looked solid and had great tools and documentation to go along
   with it. It has a lot baked into it, which is all easily configurable
   and accessible - it felt like Rails for PHP honestly.

   [3]shopifyapp is Shopifyʼs own gem for building Shopify apps on Rails;
   quick and easy. It handles authentication, installation, webhooks,
   scripttags, ESDK integration, and more. In Laravel, I could not find a
   package that covered all those points. I decided Iʼd go headfirst into
   Laravel and build a package for it.

What The Package Does

   Right from the Github page, the package handles all that shopify_app
   does:
     * Provide assistance in developing Shopify apps with Laravel
     * Integration with Shopify API
     * Authentication & installation for shops
     * Auto install app webhooks and scripttags through background jobs
     * Provide basic ESDK views
     * Handles and processes incoming webhooks
     * Handles and verifies incoming app proxy requests

   The package is fully tested and works with PHP &ge; 7 and Laravel 5.4.

Project

   You can head over to the [4]projectʼs page for full information, or
   also browse [5]the wiki for documentation, installation, and other
   topics.

   Happy coding with Shopify + Laravel!
