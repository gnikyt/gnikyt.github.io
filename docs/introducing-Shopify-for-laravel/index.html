        <p>
          As an active Ruby (and Rails) developer, I found myself regularly making Shopify apps in Rails and Sinatra.
          I've even released my own Gems to solve common (small) issues I've faced developing for these platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          PHP itself... I haven't been active in years on that front. With PHP7 however, the language is shaping up. It
          doesn't have the great method chaining or syntax beauty that Ruby does, but its a well tested, proven, and
          mature language to work with that's easily deployable to a magnitude of places without much interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being out of the PHP game for a while, I decided to survey the landscape. I used to work heavily with
          Symfony, however, it always left a sour taste in my mouth. Symfony is great... its really well structured,
          enterprise type of framework. It falls short for medium-sized projects due to the verbosity of it (in my
          personal experience).
        </p>

        <p>
          After some digging, I stumbled upon Laravel. Laravel, like many projects, uses bits of Symfony's core and
          builds on top of it. I spent a lot of time studying Laravel, its community, its activeness, its code. It
          looked solid and had great tools and documentation to go along with it. It has a lot baked into it, which is
          all easily configurable and accessible - it felt like Rails for PHP honestly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify%3Cem%3Eapp">shopifyapp</a> is Shopify's own gem for building
          Shopify apps on Rails; quick and easy. It handles authentication, installation, webhooks, scripttags, ESDK
          integration, and more. In Laravel, I could not find a package that covered all those points. I decided I'd go
          headfirst into Laravel and build a package for it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what-the-package-does">
          What The Package Does
        </h2>

        <p>
          Right from the Github page, the package handles all that <code>shopify_app</code> does:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide assistance in developing Shopify apps with Laravel
          </li>

          <li>Integration with Shopify API
          </li>

          <li>Authentication & installation for shops
          </li>

          <li>Auto install app webhooks and scripttags through background jobs
          </li>

          <li>Provide basic ESDK views
          </li>

          <li>Handles and processes incoming webhooks
          </li>

          <li>Handles and verifies incoming app proxy requests
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The package is fully tested and works with PHP &amp;ge; 7 and Laravel 5.4.
        </p>
