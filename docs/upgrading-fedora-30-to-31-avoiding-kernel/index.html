        <p>
          Fedora 30 was released on April 30th, 2019.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fedora 31 was released on October 29th, 2019.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Fedora 30 had minimal reported issues (at least socially), Fedora 31 was a different case altogether
          due to the 5.4.7 packaged kernel where Fedora 30 had 5.0 (later updated to 5.3.x).
        </p>

        <p>
          There have been several reports of users' WIFI completely dropping, Ethernet not working, audio not working,
          and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I normally wait a few months after a major release for the dust to settle, there are a few features I
          was wanting, so I decided to upgrade and create a guide on how to keep your existing kernel during the
          upgrade.
        </p>

        <h2 id="upgrade">
          Upgrade
        </h2>

        <p>
          First, make sure all packages are updated.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>sudo dnf --refresh upgrade --exclude=kernel*</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          This will refresh the repos, update your packages, and exclude any kernel updates.
        </p>

        <h2 id="system-upgrade">
          System Upgrade
        </h2>

        <p>
          Next, to upgrade to Fedora 31, run the following command.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=31 --exclude=kernel*</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          This will download (not update) all packages needed to bump to release 31, while excluding any kernel
          updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will be asked to accept various keys and accept the package summary. Once you're ready, continue the
          update.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your system will reboot to a Plymouth screen with a progress bar showing the current status of the upgrade.
        </p>

        <p>
          This upgrade takes approx. 15 minutes from my experience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="reboot">
          Reboot
        </h2>

        <p>
          Upon reboot, you'll be booting into Fedora 31, the GRUB screen should show your 5.3.x kernel still there. If
          you've missed it, run <code>uname -r</code> in the terminal to confirm the version.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's it. Please be sure to check out the <a href=
          "https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/31/ChangeSet">release notes</a> and keep an eye out for new kernel
          updates and reports to know when its safe to upgrade your kernel.
        </p>
