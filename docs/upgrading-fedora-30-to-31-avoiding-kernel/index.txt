             Upgrading Fedora 30 to 31 while avoiding kernel 5.4.7

   Jan 15, 2020 — 1.9K

   Fedora 30 was released on April 30th, 2019.

   Fedora 31 was released on October 29th, 2019.

   While Fedora 30 had minimal reported issues (at least socially), Fedora
   31 was a different case altogether due to the 5.4.7 packaged kernel
   where Fedora 30 had 5.0 (later updated to 5.3.x).

   There have been several reports of usersʼ WIFI completely dropping,
   Ethernet not working, audio not working, and so on.

   While I normally wait a few months after a major release for the dust
   to settle, there are a few features I was wanting, so I decided to
   upgrade and create a guide on how to keep your existing kernel during
   the upgrade.

Upgrade

   First, make sure all packages are updated.

   sudo dnf --refresh upgrade --exclude=kernel*

   This will refresh the repos, update your packages, and exclude any
   kernel updates.

System Upgrade

   Next, to upgrade to Fedora 31, run the following command.

   sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=31 --exclude=kernel*

   This will download (not update) all packages needed to bump to release
   31, while excluding any kernel updates.

   You will be asked to accept various keys and accept the package
   summary. Once youʼre ready, continue the update.

   Your system will reboot to a Plymouth screen with a progress bar
   showing the current status of the upgrade.

   This upgrade takes approx. 15 minutes from my experience.

Reboot

   Upon reboot, youʼll be booting into Fedora 31, the GRUB screen should
   show your 5.3.x kernel still there. If youʼve missed it, run uname -r
   in the terminal to confirm the version.

   Thatʼs it. Please be sure to check out the [3]release notes and keep an
   eye out for new kernel updates and reports to know when its safe to
   upgrade your kernel.
