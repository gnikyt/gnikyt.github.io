          Recently, I jumped back into Windows after a few months of Linux and FreeBSD. I opted to upgrade to Windows
          11 and clean out my system to be better for development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I noticed that since the upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11... general "starting" of VSCode and remote
          connecting to WSL was slow. Additonally, internal network request serving was slow; things such as Webpack
          dev server would take upwards of 5 minutes to serve a small-to-medium application.
        </p>

        <p>
          In digging into it, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4901">other people have reported similar
          issues</a>. Using <code>speedtest-cli</code>, my download was decent but my upload speed was in the 0.5-0.8
          mbps range.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to try some solutions listed in the issue and here are my personal results...
        </p>

        <h2 id="potential-solution-1">
          Potential Solution #1
        </h2>

        <p>
          Editing <code>resolv.conf</code> and <code>wsl.conf</code> to set a nameserver and disable WSL from
          autogenerating the <code>resolv.conf</code> file each time and overwriting our new settings.
        </p>

        <pre><code>sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" &gt; /etc/resolv.conf'
sudo bash -c 'echo "[network]" &gt; /etc/wsl.conf'
sudo bash -c 'echo "generateResolvConf = false" &gt;&gt; /etc/wsl.conf'
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
</code></pre>
        <p>
          For the above, this didn't change anything for me when re-running <code>speedtest-cli</code>, I was still
          seeing very slow upload speeds.
        </p>

        <h2 id="potential-solution-2">
          Potential Solution #2
        </h2>

        <p>
          Opening PowerShell in adminsitrator mode and running <code>Disable-NetAdapterLso -Name "vEthernet
          (WSL)"</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This solution seemed to actually work in my case! Webpack dev server was operating normally and
          <code>speedtest-cli</code> was reporting numbers identical to the host machine in both download and upload.
        </p>
