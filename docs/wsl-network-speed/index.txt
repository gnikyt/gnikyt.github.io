                               WSL network speed

   Nov 16, 2021

   Recently, I jumped back into Windows after a few months of Linux and
   FreeBSD. I opted to upgrade to Windows 11 and clean out my system to be
   better for development.

   I noticed that since the upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11...
   general "starting" of VSCode and remote connecting to WSL was slow.
   Additonally, internal network request serving was slow; things such as
   Webpack dev server would take upwards of 5 minutes to serve a
   small-to-medium application.

   In digging into it, [3]other people have reported similar issues. Using
   speedtest-cli, my download was decent but my upload speed was in the
   0.5-0.8 mbps range.

   I decided to try some solutions listed in the issue and here are my
   personal results...

Potential Solution #1

   Editing resolv.conf and wsl.conf to set a nameserver and disable WSL
   from autogenerating the resolv.conf file each time and overwriting our
   new settings.
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo bash -c ʼecho "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.confʼ
sudo bash -c ʼecho "[network]" > /etc/wsl.confʼ
sudo bash -c ʼecho "generateResolvConf = false" >> /etc/wsl.confʼ
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

   For the above, this didnʼt change anything for me when re-running
   speedtest-cli, I was still seeing very slow upload speeds.

Potential Solution #2

   Opening PowerShell in adminsitrator mode and running
   Disable-NetAdapterLso -Name "vEthernet (WSL)".

   This solution seemed to actually work in my case! Webpack dev server
   was operating normally and speedtest-cli was reporting numbers
   identical to the host machine in both download and upload.
