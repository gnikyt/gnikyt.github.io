                       Get single field error in Symfony

   Dec 12, 2013

   This is just a quick tid-bit/how-to!

   Recently a project came up where special front-end actions and
   structures had to take place within the view of the Twig template once
   an error occurred on specific fields. It also didnÊ¼t require enough
   attention to warrant creating a form theme.

   This is a quick way to test if a field has errors; Simply do this
   inside your Twig template...
{% raw %}{{ form.__field_name__.vars.errors|length }}{% endraw %}

   The above code will show how many errors a certain field has. A usage
   example...
{% raw %}
{% if form.__field_name__.vars.errors|length > 0 %}
  <div class="special-class-for-jquery">{{ form_errors(__field_name__) }}</div>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}

   Just replace __field_name__ with the field name you wish to use!
