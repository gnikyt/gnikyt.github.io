Background

   As an active Ruby (and Rails) developer, I found myself regularly
   making Shopify apps in Rails and Sinatra. I’ve even released my own
   Gems to solve common (small) issues I’ve faced developing for these
   platforms.

   PHP itself… I haven’t been active in years on that front. With PHP7
   however, the language is shaping up. It doesn’t have the great method
   chaining or syntax beauty that Ruby does, but its a well tested,
   proven, and mature language to work with that’s easily deployable to a
   magnitude of places without much interaction.

   Being out of the PHP game for a while, I decided to survey the
   landscape. I used to work heavily with Symfony, however, it always left
   a sour taste in my mouth. Symfony is great… its really well structured,
   enterprise type of framework. It falls short for medium-sized projects
   due to the verbosity of it (in my personal experience).

   After some digging, I stumbled upon Laravel. Laravel, like many
   projects, uses bits of Symfony’s core and builds on top of it. I spent
   a lot of time studying Laravel, its community, its activeness, its
   code. It looked solid and had great tools and documentation to go along
   with it. It has a lot baked into it, which is all easily configurable
   and accessible - it felt like Rails for PHP honestly.

   [6]shopify_app is Shopify’s own gem for building Shopify apps on Rails;
   quick and easy. It handles authentication, installation, webhooks,
   scripttags, ESDK integration, and more. In Laravel, I could not find a
   package that covered all those points. I decided I’d go headfirst into
   Laravel and build a package for it.

What The Package Does

   Right from the Github page, the package handles all that shopify_app
   does:
     * Provide assistance in developing Shopify apps with Laravel
     * Integration with Shopify API
     * Authentication & installation for shops
     * Auto install app webhooks and scripttags through background jobs
     * Provide basic ESDK views
     * Handles and processes incoming webhooks
     * Handles and verifies incoming app proxy requests

   The package is fully tested and works with PHP >= 7 and Laravel 5.4.

Project

   You can head over to the [7]project’s page for full information, or
   also browse [8]the wiki for documentation, installation, and other
   topics.

   Happy coding with Shopify + Laravel!
