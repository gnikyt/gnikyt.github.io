   Symfony Flex allows you to tailor a Symfony application to your needs
   by building it with “recipes”. It provides a way to create a very lean
   and clean Symfony application with only the bells and whistles you
   choose.

   In this post, I’ll show you how to create a Dockerized version of your
   Flex application that utilizes the Symfony local server for use during
   local development.

Setup

   If you already have a Symfony Flex application created, you can skip
   this section.

   composer create-project symfony/skeleton myapi

   This will create a skeleton project in a directory called myapi with
   everything set up and ready to go in an easy to navigate structure.

   Next, we install the API recipe which installs bundles such as
   Doctrine, CORS handling, Twig templating, validators, etc. It will give
   you barebones ability to easily create an API base.

   composer req api

   You’re now free to create any entities, repositories, controllers,
   services, etc. that you require, or you can come back to that at a
   later time, it is not required.

Dockerizing

Docker Compose

   For this example, we’ll simply set up a MySQL server, Redis server, and
   PHP CLI. We will manage all this through Docker Compose.
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_pwd
      MYSQL_DATABASE: api_db
      MYSQL_USER: api_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: api_pass
    volumes:
      - ./docker/db:/var/lib/mysql/data
    ports:
      - '3306:3306'
    restart: always
  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - '6379:6379'
    volumes:
      - ./docker/redis:/data
    entrypoint: redis-server --appendonly yes
    restart: always
  web:
    build:
      context: .
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html/
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true

   The above will pull in the mysql:5.7 image with some initial
   environment variables (you’re free to replace them). It will mount its
   data volume to ./docker/db of your myapi directory for persistence. It
   will also map port 3306 on your host machine to forward to 3306 in the
   container.

   Below that, we pull in the redis image and mount it’s volume to
   ./docker/redis of your myapi directory for storage. It will also map
   port 6379 of your host machine to forward to 6379 in the container. You
   can adjust the entrypoint to your needs.

   Lastly, web will build a custom image based on a Dockerfile below. It
   will mount your myapi directory to /var/www/html inside the container.
   It will also map port 8080 of your host machine to forward to port 80
   in the container.

   It is also a good idea to add these volume paths to your .gitignore to
   avoid checking them into your repository.

Dockerfile

# Dockerfile
FROM php:7.3-cli

# Remove restirction from installing PHP packages
RUN rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/no-debian-php

# Install required packages
RUN apt update && apt install wget php-mysql php-json php-mbstring php-xml php-c
url -y

# Extension install
RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo pdo_mysql

# Install Symfony package
RUN wget https://get.symfony.com/cli/installer -O - | bash && mv /root/.symfony/
bin/symfony /usr/local/bin/symfony

# Open port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Run it
CMD cd /var/www/html && symfony server:start --no-tls --port=80

   The above Dockerfile will pull in the php:7.3-cli image. Since
   Symfony’s local server will be handling the requests, we do not need
   Nginx, Apache, mod_php, or php-fpm.

   In the commands, we tell it to install wget which is required to
   install the Symfony CLI tools, and other PHP packages (by removing the
   APT restriction). We also open up port 80. At the end, we change our
   directory to /var/www/html where our myapi directory is mounted, and
   run the Symfony local server on port 80.

Running

   It is a good idea to now modify your .env.local file to connect to the
   container’s MySQL instance and Redis instance with the credentials set
   up in the docker-compose.yml file and the special mapping keywords,
   redis and db for the address.

   Examples:
     * DATABASE_URL=mysql://:@mysql:3306/?serverVersion=5.7
     * REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379?timeout=5

   Finally, executing docker-compose up will build and boot the
   containers. If you’re successful… you should see the Symfony local
   server running with a message similar to:

   [OK] Web server listening on http://127.0.0.1:80

   Now, if you open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080 (8080 is our
   local port which will forward to port 80 in the container), you should
   see the Symfony welcome screen.

   As a side note, it would be a good idea to set up a hosts file entry so
   you don’t need to type your localhost every time, and also enabling
   HTTPS would be a good measure, but not necessarily needed for local
   development.

Conclusion

   That concludes the basic setup to Dockerize a Symfony Flex API
   application.
