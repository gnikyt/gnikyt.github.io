          Back in November <a href="/developing-sanely-on-windows">I wrote a post</a> about how to develop sanely on
          Windows. It was a successful experiment that resulted in a usable environment to develop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I am re-visiting this with some more notes as I've now been full-time developing on Windows for a
          month now. With this, I've changed some tactics and have come to a much more streamlined solution.
        </p>

        <h2 id="changes">
          Changes
        </h2>

        <p>
          Previously I installed Ubuntu Server onto VMWare. I would SSH into the environment using a terminal and had a
          shared development folder so I could use the browser and editor on Windows side, while all code execution was
          contained on the VM side.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I've done away with the VM. With Docker working well on Windows, there's really not much need for a VM
          anymore since Docker is a more full-featured stable solution anyways; but the big change... <a href=
          "https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about">WSL (Bash on Ubuntu on Windows)</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I previously explored this option last time but it was incomplete and had issues, mainly the lack of inotify
          support for file system notifications which most build systems rely on. <a href=
          "https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2017/04/18/file-system-improvements-to-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/">
          With the latest creator's update</a> released this month, they not only solved the inotify issues but many
          others.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've now switched to using a combination of using WSL and Docker - it works wonderfully.
        </p>

        <h2 id="side-note">
          Side Note
        </h2>

        <p>
          The great thing about WSL is it can easily integrate with VSCode's integrated terminal feature.
        </p>

        <p>

          "/assets/images/0000/vs-code-wsl.png"></a>
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion... I've had no issues yet with this setup. Docker + WSL + Windows = A happy environment.
        </p>
