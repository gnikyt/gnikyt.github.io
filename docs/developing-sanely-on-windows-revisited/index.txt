                     Developing sanely on Windows revisited

   /* May 10, 2017 — 1.9KB */

   Back in November [3]I wrote a post about how to develop sanely on
   Windows. It was a successful experiment that resulted in a usable
   environment to develop.

   Today, I am re-visiting this with some more notes as I’ve now been
   full-time developing on Windows for a month now. With this, I’ve
   changed some tactics and have come to a much more streamlined solution.

Changes

   Previously I installed Ubuntu Server onto VMWare. I would SSH into the
   environment using a terminal and had a shared development folder so I
   could use the browser and editor on Windows side, while all code
   execution was contained on the VM side.

   Now, I’ve done away with the VM. With Docker working well on Windows,
   there’s really not much need for a VM anymore since Docker is a more
   full-featured stable solution anyways; but the big change… [4]WSL (Bash
   on Ubuntu on Windows).

   I previously explored this option last time but it was incomplete and
   had issues, mainly the lack of inotify support for file system
   notifications which most build systems rely on. [5]With the latest
   creator’s update released this month, they not only solved the inotify
   issues but many others.

   I’ve now switched to using a combination of using WSL and Docker - it
   works wonderfully.

Side Note

   The great thing about WSL is it can easily integrate with VSCode’s
   integrated terminal feature.

   [6]VS Code with WSL

   In conclusion… I’ve had no issues yet with this setup. Docker + WSL +
   Windows = A happy environment.
