                               QR Code gradients

   /* Jul 13, 2013 — 3.4KB */

   Qr codes and matrices are a great way to share content to an audience,
   it allows anybody to simply put their phone up to the Qr image, scan
   it, and see what’s inside. The premise of QrInColor.com was to provide
   a free way for users to not only create linked Qr codes, but to
   customize them as well - with color

   For the QrInColor.com web-application initially we used [3]Endroid Qr
   Bundle, when we re-vamped the look and features of the app into
   [4]Symfony from [5]Silex, we wanted to allow users to generate not only
   colored Qr codes, but two-tone gradient colors as well. I wanted to
   accomplish this without modifying the Endroid package as its not really
   it’s purpose to do such a thing.

   This created a problem… how do I create a gradient on the Qr code? I
   came up with a solution: colorize the Qr with [6]Imagick using their
   top and bottom colors the user picked then, “blend” the two images
   together to create a gradient effect.
   qr code base qr code base

   We would first take the Qr data the user entered and generate a black,
   basic, Qr code. Which is our canvas to work with. Now, we had to apply
   their top color chosen (RGB) to the base Qr and render it, using
   similar shell command below.

/usr/bin/convert qr.png -fuzz 60% -fill 'rgb(161,161,163)' -opaque black qr_top.
png

   qr code top qr code top

   This is the result of the above command. It replaces all black with a
   fuzz of 60% threshold with the color chosen by the user,
   rgb(161,161,163).

   It’s nothing spectacular; but it works. Now, we need to do the same for
   the bottom color the user chose. Again we use the base Qr render to
   apply the color to.

/usr/bin/convert qr.png -fuzz 60% -fill 'rgb(248,150,39)' -opaque black qr_botto
m.png

   qr code bottom qr code bottom

   This is the result of the above command. It replaces all black with a
   fuzz of 60% threshold with the color chosen by the user,
   rgb(248,150,39).

   Finally, we need to blend them together as if they we’re two layers in
   gimp. To accomplish this, we need to set the gray Qr we just rendered,
   to go from a gray color to complete transparency.

/usr/bin/convert qr_top.png -size 150x150 gradient: -compose copy_opacity -compo
site qr_gradient.png

   This creates the effect we are looking for. Color at top, transparent
   at bottom. Now we place the gray transparent Qr on top of the orange
   Qr. Finally, here is the result!

/usr/bin/composite qr_bottom.png -compose Dst_Over qr_gradient.png result.png

   result result 2

   Unfortunately, I did not choose very vibrant colors to blend (gray and
   orange) but the effect is there, I’ve included another example with two
   better colors. Now, I’m sure there are better ways to produce these
   gradients, but the point of this post is that there was a problem I
   faced with a client’s website, I used my brain to come up with a
   solution and it worked. A road block can always be passed; just don’t
   pass the ones with cops posted, that won’t end well.
