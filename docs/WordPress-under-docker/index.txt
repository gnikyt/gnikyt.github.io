                          WordPress Under Docker guide

   Jun 15, 2017 — 3.6K

Purpose

   There are many lengthy guides out there for the official Docker image
   for WordPress. However, some people have a little trouble getting going
   so I will quickly provide some tips to help out.

   I havenʼt used WordPress professionally in a long time, but I decided
   to do some weekend digging to keep my brain fresh, so forgive any
   errors ;)

Setup

  Directories

   Letʼs create a basic directory structure to use. Keep in mind, this is
   geared for theme development.
     * {your_theme}/

     * wordpress/

     * wp-content/

     * themes/
     * (your-theme)/
     * uploads/

   We only need to track our theme, so we do not need to install the whole
   WordPress system.

   Once done, be sure to chmod 755 wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ so
   WordPress can write to this directory when uploading media.

  Docker

   Next, letʼs get Docker ready. The simplest way is to use a [3]Docker
   Compose file. Itʼs a simple YML-formatted file thatʼs easy to read for
   anyone.

   Based on [4]Wordpressʼ Offical Image, Iʼve compiled the following
   docker-compose.yml [5]file you can use.

   Simply replace {YOURTHEME} with your theme name and save it to the root
   of {yourtheme}/
   directory.

  Volumes

   In the docker-compose.yml file youʼll notice two entries under volumes.

   One maps the theme folder to the WordPress install so itʼs visible to
   WordPress, the other maps, read-write, wp-content/uploads to the
   WordPress install as well so it can write and read media from a
   location accessible.

  Git Ignore

   Now that you have the directories set up, Docker Compose ready, volumes
   mapped... its time to setup Git.

   wordpress/wp-content/uploads/*

   Now, we keep track of only our theme.

Running

   Once youʼre done the quick setup simply run docker-compose up in the
   main directory. On the first run, youʼll have to run through the
   WordPress installation process.

   After itʼs done, simply log in and visit Appearance. If you have your
   theme setup as per WordPress requirements (style.css (with info) and
   index.php) then you will see it in the theme list. Hit "Activate" and
   youʼre ready to go.

Windows (WSL1) Tips

   If youʼre running this under WSL1, be sure you have Docker on Windows
   settings set to expose Docker daemon without TLS (itʼs under General
   panel).

   Also, WSL1 accesses your C: drive via /mnt/c but Docker requires /c. To
   resolve this issue simply create a symlink via ln -s /mnt/c /c. If this
   is not done, youʼll have issues with Docker under WSL trying to find
   files and map volumes. This means you also need to run docker-compose
   commands under /c as well.

   To quickly switch to /c no matter what directory youʼre under, open
   $HOME/.bash_aliases and add this entry:
alias cswap=ʼcd `pwd | sed ʼs,/mnt,,gʼ`ʼ

   Now, any directory youʼre in, simply run cswap and itʼll move you to /c
tyler@bash[/mnt/c/Users/Tyler/Development/GitHub/wordpress-docker-setup/]$ cswap
tyler@bash[/c/Users/Tyler/Development/GitHub/wordpress-docker-setup/]$ docker-co
mpose up
Starting...

Further Exploring

   [6]Iʼve set up a repo on Github which contains all Iʼve talked about
   above plus some extras like a basic Grunt setup for managing asset
   files. Feel free to clone, run docker-compose up, and play around!

   I hope this has helped anyone struggling.
