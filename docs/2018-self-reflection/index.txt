                              2018 Self reflection

   Feb 06, 2019 — 4.0KB

   It is a couple of months into 2019 already! I sat down and thought
   about all Iʼve done in 2018 in regards to my digital landscape. On
   initial spark of this, I didnʼt think of much therefore, I didnʼt do
   much; but, I was wrong!

Software

  Open Source

   Last year I hunkered down and focused on my open source projects.

   A few silly ones like [3]movie-barcode, [4]CloudApp-Bash, or [5]With
   and some more important ones, which have gained some popularity, such
   as [6]Laravel Shopify and [7]Basic Shopify API.

   Focusing on my open source work has not only allowed me to refine my
   existing public code (which some of it has aged), keep self-improving,
   but also help others whoʼve faced similar issues.

   In regards to Laravel Shopify in particular, I hinged on learning the
   core of Laravel, and coming from a previous Symfony background, this
   was not hard - just different. Laravel feels more like Rails for PHP -
   a framework to get things done quickly. Laravel was missing a decent
   Shopify boilerplate package at the time so I created the package from
   the ground-up to follow similar practices to how Railsʼ version,
   shopifyapp gem_ does.

   It has since gained a lot of popularity with many helpful contributors
   both in pull requests and general questions people post in the issue
   section. This, in-conjunction with Basic Shopify API package, has
   allowed many companies (based on their personal thank you emails to me)
   to create Laravel-powered Shopify apps fairly quickly, letting them
   focus on their apps code and not the setup.

   Open-source ecosystems are always great to be involved with. Iʼm glad
   Iʼve had the late nights this year to give back to it.

Operating

   Its been a hectic year bouncing between operating systems. As a long
   time Linux user, I broke the streak in 2014 when I purchased my
   Macbook. However, last year my Macbook finally hit the grave and I
   purchased a Thinkpad T580 to replace it (with some great specs too!),
   leading me to use Windows for a few months, but now Iʼm back on Linux!

   Thankfully for software like Vagrant, Docker, WSL, VSCode, and more, my
   productivity hasnʼt been impacted between these transitions since most
   everything I write these days is either fairly portable or easily setup
   on another system.

   Iʼve opted for [8]PopOS on my T580 given its great support for dual
   graphics cards and customizations. I even have a [9]recent post
   outlining some steps I took to optimize the T580 for daily-driver
   usage.

Code

   Besides moving away from Ruby/Rails due to less demand, and focusing
   back to PHP/Laravel/Symfony and Python, Iʼve also taken a great focus
   on modern Javascript/Node and Typescript.

   Iʼve fallen in love with Typescript (compared to plain Javascript). Not
   only is it backed by Microsoft, but its integration with VSCode has
   been great. It allows you to write code you can trust by ensuring
   values in, out and across, are correct and properly formed... something
   greatly missing from plain Javascript.

   From a pure web-perspective... a good Typescript setup with
   Babel/Browserify and some polyfills, can allow you to write modern
   Javascript that transpiles down to something thatʼs able to work even
   on older browsers. Keeping a nice, clean, modern source code.

   I currently have a large Typescript library assisting an enterprise
   company processing over 15 million hits a month successfully.

   Besides the backend, I have also hit the mobile space with Flutter/Dart
   and ReactNative. I had a chance to work on some interesting projects
   involving Bluetooth low energy (BLE) between custom devices and mobile
   phones, as well as some cool unique NFC implementations.
