          It is a couple of months into 2019 already! I sat down and thought about all I’ve done in 2018 in regards to
          my digital landscape. On initial spark of this, I didn’t think of much therefore, I didn’t do much; but, I
          was wrong!

          Open Source
        </h3>

        <p>
          Last year I hunkered down and focused on my open source projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few silly ones like <a href="https://github.com/gnikyt/movie-barcode">movie-barcode</a>, <a href=
          "https://github.com/gnikyt/cloudapp-bash">CloudApp-Bash</a>, or <a href=
          "https://github.com/gnikyt/with">With</a> and some more important ones, which have gained some popularity,
          such as <a href="https://github.com/gnikyt/laravel-shopify">Laravel Shopify</a> and <a href=
          "https://github.com/gnikyt/Basic-Shopify-API">Basic Shopify</a> API.
        </p>

        <p>
          Focusing on my open source work has not only allowed me to refine my existing public code (which some of it
          has aged), keep self-improving, but also help others who’ve faced similar issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          In regards to <em>Laravel Shopify</em> in particular, I hinged on learning the core of Laravel, and coming
          from a previous Symfony background, this was not hard - just <em>different</em>. Laravel feels more like
          <em>Rails</em> for PHP - a framework to get things done quickly. <em>Laravel</em> was missing a decent
          Shopify boilerplate package at the time so I created the package from the ground-up to follow similar
          practices to how <em>Rails’</em> version, <em>shopify_app gem</em> does.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has since gained a lot of popularity with many helpful contributors both in pull requests and general
          questions people post in the issue section. This, in-conjunction with <em>Basic Shopify API</em> package, has
          allowed many companies (based on their personal thank you emails to me) to create Laravel-powered Shopify
          apps fairly quickly, letting them focus on their apps code and not the setup.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open-source ecosystems are always great to be involved with. I’m glad I’ve had the late nights this year to
          give back to it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="operating">
          Operating
        </h2>

        <p>
          Its been a hectic year bouncing between operating systems. As a long time Linux user, I broke the streak in
          2014 when I purchased my Macbook. However, last year my Macbook finally hit the grave and I purchased a
          Thinkpad T580 to replace it (with some great specs too!), leading me to use Windows for a few months, but now
          I’m back on Linux!
        </p>

        <p>
          Thankfully for software like Vagrant, Docker, WSL, VSCode, and more, my productivity hasn’t been impacted
          between these transitions since most everything I write these days is either fairly portable or easily setup
          on another system.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve opted for <a href="https://system76.com/pop">PopOS</a> on my T580 given its great support for dual
          graphics cards and customizations. I even have a <a href="/thinkpad-t580-on-linux/">recent post</a> outlining
          some steps I took to optimize the T580 for daily-driver usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides moving away from <em>Ruby/Rails</em> due to less demand, and focusing back to
          <em>PHP/Laravel/Symfony</em> and <em>Python</em>, I’ve also taken a great focus on modern
          <em>Javascript/Node</em> and <em>Typescript.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve fallen in love with <em>Typescript</em> (compared to plain Javascript). Not only is it backed by
          <em>Microsoft</em>, but its integration with <em>VSCode</em> has been great. It allows you to write code you
          can trust by ensuring values in, out and across, are correct and properly formed… something greatly missing
          from plain Javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
          From a pure web-perspective… a good <em>Typescript</em> setup with <em>Babel/Browserify and some
          polyfills,</em> can allow you to write modern Javascript that transpiles down to something that’s able to
          work even on older browsers. Keeping a nice, clean, modern source code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently have a large <em>Typescript</em> library assisting an enterprise company processing over 15
          million hits a month successfully.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides the backend, I have also hit the mobile space with Flutter/Dart and ReactNative. I had a chance to
          work on some interesting projects involving Bluetooth low energy (BLE) between custom devices and mobile
          phones, as well as some cool unique NFC implementations.
