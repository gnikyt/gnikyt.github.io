                            all_products... finally

   Jun 24, 2015 — 844B

   [3]Shopify has finally implemented a global variable for accessing
   products.

   Shopify has [4]global variables for many things like Collections,
   Linklists, pages, etc, so you can do things such as access a collection
   by its handle collections.my-cool-toys.products. However, it always
   lacked the ability to look up products by their handle until now.

   Thereʼs no documentation yet for the new variable but as the Github
   comment states, simply use all_products[ʼhandle-hereʼ]
<img src="{% raw %}{{ all_products[ʼmario-party-gameʼ].featured_image.src | img_
url: ʼmediumʼ }}{% endraw %}">
