Introduction

   I have been struggling recently to find a good match of the following:
    1. Productivity
    2. Simplistic
    3. Beauty
    4. No hassle

   Plasma on its own, much like any other desktop environment such as XFCE
   or GNOME, does a great job of throwing you into a full-featured and
   worry-free setup. Everything from suspending, audio, Bluetooth, and
   more is handled pretty much out-of-the-box these days.

   However, all the major desktop environments are geared towards floating
   and manually managing windows like you would with Windows or OSX. You
   end up spending a good chunk of time attached to your mouse… moving,
   resizing, and managing those windows to do your work. Yes, you could
   tweak the settings of these desktop environments to semi-simulate what
   a good window manager can do, but it is not the same.

   With a configurable window manager, such as i3, sway, bspwm, and
   others, you’re able to solely use your keyboard to manage windows in a
   way that’s efficient, natural, and powerful.

   For someone like me, who doesn’t use a mouse (I use my Thinkpad dot
   only) and has back/neck issues… the less I move around (reaching for
   mice), the better!

   So, to hit all points above… a combo of Plasma and i3 works wonders.
   And the best thing is that it takes no time at all to setup.

Setup

   I followed [4]this guide originally with some tweaks. Since I use
   OpenSUSE, I did the following for my system (slightly different paths):

# Install i3
sudo zypper in i3

# Create a Plasma + i3 launcher script
$ echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n\nKDEWM=/usr/bin/i3 startkde' > /usr/local/bin/startkde-i3
$ sudo chown root.root /usr/local/bin/startkde-i3
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/startkde-i3

# Create a custom desktop sessions directory
$ sudo cp -a /usr/share/xsessions /usr/local/share/xsessions

# Create a new desktop session file for plasma + i3
$ cp /usr/local/share/xsessions/default.desktop /usr/local/share/xsessions/plasm
a-i3.desktop
$ sudo sed -i 's|/usr/bin/startkde|/usr/local/bin/startkde-i3|' /usr/local/share
/xsessions/plasma-i3.desktop
$ sudo sed -i '/Name.*=/ s/$/-i3/' /usr/local/share/xsessions/plasma-i3.desktop

# Configure sddm (the login screen) to use our new desktop sessions directory
$ echo -e '\n\n[X11]\nSessionDir=/usr/local/share/xsessions' | sudo tee -a /usr/
lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d/00-general.conf

   Logging out, you’ll be presented with an option in SDDM for Plasma-i3.

Tweaking

   Several tweaks are needed to ensure an environment that works well for
   Plasma and i3.

   This involves killing off Plasma desktop, telling i3 how to handle
   certain windows/popups/dialogs, and configuring launchers.

   [5].Xresources is a great way to configure cross-compatible settings
   for cursors, fonts, colors, and more. Mine simply has just that -
   colors, cursors, fonts, and some settings for URxvt (terminal).

   You can utilize your Xresources to pull in config values into i3.

   [6]Here is my i3 config, which has pre-defined settings for handling
   the different Plasma windows. I have several standard keybindings
   defined, launchers, and window management. You can go in-depth as you
   like… you can target certain windows/popups/window-titles and more to
   do anything you like. You can have certain windows float, certain
   windows open on a monitor or workspace, certain windows have
   priorities, certain windows that open next to other certain windows,
   and so forth; you can go nuts!

  Bars

   You’re able to use any “bar” or panel you like with this setup..
   weather it be i3bar, polybar, or plain Plasma panel as I have.

   If you decide to use Plasma panels, definitely install [7]Virtual
   Desktop Bar Widget, its a virtual desktop pager which is configurable
   and simple, and mimics how most other “bars” handle workspaces (its the
   widget in the screenshot above with “web”, “code”, “mail”, etc).

Conclusion

   Give a try. My dot files for i3 and .Xresources has a good starting
   ground which you can expand upon and enjoy a mouseless experience!
