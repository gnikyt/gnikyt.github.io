                           When to use a VPS vs PaaS

   Mar 08, 2017

Introduction

  What is a VPS

   A VPS is a Virtual Private Server. A server running on more powerful
   hardware than the standard "shared hosting" plans (usually). Every
   "account" has its own physical space on the server in virtual
   compartments with super-level access. Software is set up independently
   in each space. Itʼs like your own piece of pie on the server.

   Most VPS providers offer both managed (host manages for you) or
   unmanaged (clean slate for you to break!) plans. There are many pricing
   levels and many providers. The top providers mentioned the past few
   years are:
     * [3]DigitalOcean (one I personally choose to use)
     * [4]Linode
     * [5]Vultr
     * [6]Scaleway

   Each of these providers is great. They offer features such as instant
   upgrades, point-n-click setup of instances, pre-bundled setups, DNS
   configurations, IP management, backups, and more. Their prices are
   relatively the same as well.

   For example, with DigitalOcean, on a $5 per month plan, you can get
   512MB of RAM, 1 CPU, 20GB SSD space, and be up-and-running in minutes.
   This is a very cost-effective method for those who want to have freedom
   with their server to host their applications and websites.

   The vast amount of tutorials and community support out there for these
   services make any modifications easy for even new-comers.

  What is a PaaS

   PaaS or Platform as a Service is a cloud-computing service that
   provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run and manage their
   applications/websites without the complexity of building and
   maintaining the infrastructure associated with developing and
   launching.

   With [7]Heroku for example, you can set up an account in minutes,
   generate a [8]Procfile for your app, and deploy your code through Git.
   Heroku will pull your code, read your Procfile, and build a system that
   suits your code, launching it mere minutes with no interaction on your
   part. It comes with several add-ons that are point-and-click setups
   like Redis, Postgres, Loader.io, and more.

   These services allow you to focus on code, not the server. You donʼt
   need to worry about the command line, resource scaling, migrations,
   errors... its all taken care of you. This, of course, comes at a cost
   to you though compared to a VPS.

   Heroku is billed by the usage time of the server (how long itʼs
   running). They have free hobby plans to get you going, but once you
   need more resources, the price will jump. A small app on Heroku could
   start out as $10 a month. A medium-sized medium-load app could quickly
   jump to $260 a month from experience.

  What to Choose

   Well, itʼs up to your needs. Go "cheap", manage the server yourself,
   then youʼd pick a VPS. Focus on code and not worry about the server,
   youʼd pick a PaaS.

   Personally, if its a minimal load and minimal traffic app, Iʼd spin up
   a DigitalOcean instance, spend the time to configure it properly,
   deploy the app and let it be. Sometimes, this is all the client is
   willing to afford anyways.

   If its an app that is going to experience high traffic, high load, and
   needs to stay dependable… Iʼd choose a PaaS every time. I donʼt need to
   worry about recourses and I can easily scale the databases, CPU, RAM,
   etc. as needed with a click of a button. When itʼs crunch time... this
   can be a big help.
