                       Building a BASH template engine /

   Earlier this year I migrated my blog away from Jekyll because it was
   such a large setup for such a small blog to maintain. I wanted
   something more “portable” without libraries, so I settled to build my
   blog and it’s generation with BASH.

   Everything needed was built out: frontmatter processing, Markdown to
   HTML generation, post handling, page handling, category support, RSS
   support, sitemap support, and more.

   Originally, I wrote a very basic template handler which essentially
   just sniffed the first few characters of a string to know an action to
   take, example: ${inc:file.html} would include a file into the template,
   ${var} would replace itself with the applicable variable, and so on. It
   began getting more complex where I required some basic if/else
   statements and looping, which was something difficult with the basic
   template handler I originally wrote.

   I decided to rebuild it from scratch, taking inspiration from Mustache
   syntax, and ensuring it was more than just a simple find and replace
   operation as it was before.

   The plan was to do the following:
     * Detect the applicable template tags
     * For each template tag:
          + Parse it character-by-character to determine:
               o It’s operation type
               o It’s optional ask
               o It’s optional contents
               o And more
     * Once determined, run the applicable operation to produce a result
     * Take the result and replace the original template tag with that
       result

   Initial supports I targeted:
     * Variables: {{VAR}}
     * Variables with filters: {{VAR|UPPERCASE|REPLACE x y}}
     * If statements: {{#VAR}}I exist!{{/VAR}}
     * Unless statements: {{^VAR}}I do not exist!{{/VAR}}
     * Partial includes: {{>file.html}}
     * Looping: {{@FOREACH var}}{{KEY}}: {{VALUE}}{{/FOREACH var}}
     * Assignment/Capture: {{@ASSIGN XYZ}}{{VAR|UPPERCASE}} is
       cool!{{/@ASSIGN}}
     * Custom functions: {{@MONEY USD}}4500{{/MONEY USD}}

   The method I chose, since BASH is limited, was to go
   character-by-character through the input.
     * If { was the current character, I peek ahead to know if the next
       character is also a {
     * If the current character and next are both {{, I know this is a
       variable or block
     * Next, the inside is parsed until }}
     * If determined to be a block, then everything after }} until {{/ is
       captured
     * Once everything is captured, depending on the operation, it would
       run specific functions to replace the input contents with the
       parsed contents

   [10]I built a library to handle this called be.

   Example usage, with custom functions and filters:
#!/bin/bash

. ./be

be_bold() {
  local input
  input=$(cat -)
  echo "<strong>${input}</strong>"
}

be_replace() {
  local input
  input=$(cat -)
  echo "${input//$1/$2}"
}

be_capitalize() {
  local input
  input=$(cat -)
  echo "${input^}"
}

be_equals() {
  local block
  block=$(cat -)

  if [[ "$1" == "$2" ]]; then
    be <<< "$block"
  else
    # Failed, return nothing.
    echo ""
  fi
}

NAME="Joe"
LIKES="hockey,soccer"
TPL=$(cat <<EOF
  Well, well, hello {{NAME|APPEND e|APPEND e}}!
  {{@ASSIGN GOODBYE}}Goodbye, {{NAME|CAPITALIZE}}!{{/ASSIGN GOODBYE}}
  {{#LIKES}}
    So {{NAME|REPLACE "e" "ey"|BOLD}}, I heard you like:
    {{@FOREACH LIKES ,}}
      {{@ASSIGN IS_HOCKEY}}{{@EQUALS VALUE "hockey"}}true{{/EQUALS VALUE "hockey
"}}{{/ASSIGN IS_HOCKEY}}
      {{KEY1}}) {{VALUE|CAPITALIZE}}{{#IS_HOCKEY}} (love!){{/IS_HOCKEY}}{{^LAST}
}; and {{/LAST}}
    {{/FOREACH LIKES ,}}
    {{@RAW}}Won't be processed: {{NAME}}{{/RAW}}
  {{/LIKES}}
  {{GOODBYE}}
EOF
)

echo "$TPL" | be

   Output:
  Well, well, hello Joeee!


    So <strong>Joey</strong>, I heard you like:


      1) Hockey (love!); and


      2) Soccer

    Won't be processed: {{NAME}}

   BASH is definately not the best solution for a template engine,
   however, you can view the entire solution on [11]here and modify for
   your needs.
