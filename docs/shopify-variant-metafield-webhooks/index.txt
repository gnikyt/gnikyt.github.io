   When you update a metafield for a customer in Shopify, the Customer
   Update Webhook is triggered. Similarly, updating a product metafield
   fires the Product Update Webhook. However, updating a metafield on a
   product variant does not trigger the Variant Update Webhook.

   Recently, I needed to be notified about variant metafield updates to
   sync them with an internal system. Since the webhook doesn’t fire for
   these changes, the only alternative would be to inefficiently poll the
   variants for updates. Fortunately, I found a workaround based on
   information from Shopify.dev.

   Metaobjects as the storage for the variant metafields. Althrough
   seemingly rough on the surface, it did actually work for our needs.
   What I did was create a “Variant” metaobject, added a field called
   “Variant ID” which was a string and set to be the display code. This
   means that the variant ID would become the handle of the metaobject
   entry. Other fields required, which normally would’ve lived in the
   variant metafield level, were then added to this new metaobject.

   All existing variant metafields were deleted and a single metafield on
   the variant level was added called “Meta”, which was a metafield that
   links to a singular metaobject. By configuring it this way, clicking on
   “Meta” inside a variant would allow for adding information to the new
   metaobject, or updating the existing metaobject for that variant.

   Metaobjects do support webhook notifications for create, update, and
   delete, it even allows filtering for only the webhooks you require. For
   this, I filtered by the new “Variant” metaobject, to only recieve
   notifications for those.

   Hopefully Shopify will allow the Variant Update Webhook to fire in the
   future when a metafield changes, but for now, this workaround solved
   the issue.
