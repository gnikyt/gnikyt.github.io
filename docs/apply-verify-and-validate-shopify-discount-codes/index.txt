               Apply, verify, and validate Shopify discount codes

   /* Oct 19, 2018 — 737B */

   Shopify doesnʼt have an API to verify discounts, however, I have found
   a little workaround.

   By making an AJAX call to /discount/(code), Shopify will set a cookie
   telling the checkout to auto-apply a discount on a visit to the
   checkout page.

   Next, making an AJAX call to /checkout, weʼre able to parse the HTML
   and determine if the discount code worked!

   Hereʼs an example of it in action:
