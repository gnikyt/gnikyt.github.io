   I regularly use [12]shopify_app. It's a great way to get an app,
   embedded or not, up and running with Rails.

   Sometimes I'll create apps with shopify_app which are to be used by
   only one store. These apps sometimes have a front-end component for the
   themes... proxy integration, or JSON data fetching. I'd hate to have
   someone poke around and install the client's app to their shop.

   In the past, I limited access to shopify_app's session controller by
   having a before_action callback to confirm the shop. This gets
   repetitive quick and its not a central solution meaning its hard to
   update should the Gem change.

   I decided to create a Gem for this problem which allows you to
   whitelist shops to have access to installing or accessing the app's
   backend. [13]shopify_app_whitelist adds a Railite which automatically
   injects a controller concern into your ApplicationController. It also
   adds a couple of settings to shopify_app's config so you can define
   your whitelist settings. I figured I would make it as easy as possible.

   You simply need to add the Gem to your Gemfile, add two configuration
   lines, and you're set. The Gem is fully tested and documented if you
   want to dig into the code. I hope someone will find it useful!
