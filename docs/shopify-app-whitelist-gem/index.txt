                           shopify_app_whitelist Gem

   Nov 26, 2016 — 1.5K

   I regularly use [3]shopifyapp. Itʼs a great way to get an app, embedded
   or not, up and running with Rails.

   Sometimes Iʼll create apps with shopify_app which are to be used by
   only one store. These apps sometimes have a front-end component for the
   themes... proxy integration, or JSON data fetching. Iʼd hate to have
   someone poke around and install the clientʼs app to their shop.

   In the past, I limited access to shopifyappʼs session controller by
   having a beforeaction
   callback to confirm the shop. This gets repetitive quick and its not a
   central solution meaning its hard to update should the Gem change.

   I decided to create a Gem for this problem which allows you to
   whitelist shops to have access to installing or accessing the appʼs
   backend. [4]shopifyappwhitelist adds a Railite which automatically
   injects a controller concern into your ApplicationController. It also
   adds a couple of settings to shopify_appʼs config so you can define
   your whitelist settings. I figured I would make it as easy as possible.

   You simply need to add the Gem to your Gemfile, add two configuration
   lines, and youʼre set. The Gem is fully tested and documented if you
   want to dig into the code. I hope someone will find it useful!
