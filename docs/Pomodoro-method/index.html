          I've had a history of a bad back and neck, ever since I was a kid. I've seen a chiropractor countless times
          about my issues. Sitting all day at a desk in my adult years doesn't help at all to that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Researching in help for this, besides ergonomics of the workstation, I stumbled upon the Pomodoro method. A
          small addition to the day, but a big pay off in my health.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what-is-a-pomodoro-clock">
          What is a Pomodoro Clock
        </h2>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">idea</a> is about sectioning work into timed
          intervals, typically 25 minutes. After completing an interval of work, you take a 5-minute break. After 4
          intervals of work, you take a longer, 15-30 minute break.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your brain needs a break, but also your body. As a programmer, you're desk locked most of the time. You need
          time to decompress, stretch, and realign yourself from time to time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sticking to the Pomodoro method, you'll get in a rhythm of doing your work, then having your break, allowing
          you to get up out of your desk. This can prevent back issues, neck issues, soreness, and burnouts.
        </p>

        <h2 id="pomodoro-amp-programming">
          Pomodoro & Programming
        </h2>

        <p>
          Programmers <em>hate</em> interruptions. A minor interruption to a programmer can on-average, take 10-15
          minutes to "recover" back into the mindset of the task at hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing about programming is you're mentally managing connections between systems, files, methods, etc. An
          interruption can sever those connections instantly and require you to rebuild it before starting work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Its as if you had 5 books open on a table and you're reading different paragraphs in each book which all
          relate. You're in the zone connecting all these similar paragraphs of information for research... when
          suddenly - someone asks you where you bought your backpack. Oops, there goes your train of thought, and
          you'll sit there looking at those 5 books and no longer have an idea of where you were.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is hard to turn tasks of programming work into sections of 25 minutes due to this. When the timer is up,
          you're <em>supposed</em> to take a 5-minute break, but if you're deep into a task, it could seem like an
          interruption and distraction. It's hard.
        </p>

          Overcoming & Adapting
        </h2>

        <p>
          I was skeptical the method would work for me, the thought of stopping when the timer is done just kept a
          message playing in my head, <em>"this is a bad idea, this is a bad idea,"</em> because I felt this would
          cause me to lose track of what I was doing and hinder my day, not improve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, due to my past and current back/neck issues, I decided to give it a go - rip the bandaid off.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first few days were hard. Several times the timer would go off and I would say, <em>"one more minute I'll
          be good,"</em> *"one more minute, I'll have the task done,"* and guess what... it was never a minute. I got
          into that deep vibe and before I knew it, hours past and I was sore and my eyes were tired.
        </p>

        <p>
          I realized this and decided I have to be more proactive on it. Adapt.
        </p>

        <p>
          When that timer would go off, I'd take a mental note of my current status and just drop it all, stand up, and
          walk around... get a coffee... decompress for 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, coming back to the work after the break, it took a few minutes to realign, which was frustrating at
          first, but I knew it was worth it for my health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overtime (currently, a month doing this), realigning surprisingly got easier and easier, I somehow trained
          myself better coming back to a task.
        </p>

          It's amazing. 5-minute breaks after every task seem small. But the posture of my body, pain, soreness, and
          mental state, have all been improved by doing these little breaks and timed workloads.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have time to stand up, walk, stretch, and let my eyes adjust to something besides a glaring LCD panel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Its a hard adjustment but just try it, commit to it, and try it for a week. It helped me.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are phone apps, web apps, desktop apps. You can even buy a physical timer to slap on your desk. Some
          are bare, some are rich in features.
        </p>

        <p>
          I just needed a timer for the work (25 minutes), break (5 minutes), and a long break (15-30 minutes). An
          addon for my Firefox fit the bill perfect, called <a href="https://github.com/samueljun/tomato-clock">Tomoto
          Clock</a> which is under active development. It supports the 3 types of timers, with a visual/sound
          notification, it also keeps stats of your daily usage for tasks and breaks. Its super simple to use.
