   This past week I was assigned to heavily customize a Woocommerce
   install on a client's successful store. What needed to be done on one
   task, was to give the customers the ability to filter products on the
   product's page by a specific set of categories. In other words: Only
   show the products in X Category.

Sure, this should be easy

   Now, reading up on the Woocommerce documentation, I came across the
   filter named woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args which seemed like it
   would fit the bill and allow you to modify the post query, as shown in
   [11]this example snippit. My assumption being, $args was used similar
   to providing an array of args to get_posts or WP_Query. I was wrong -
   dead wrong. It turns out after all, $args passed to the
   woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args filter is more of a collection of
   direct SQL commands which WordPress compiles. This means simply passing
   $args['product_cat'] = xxx; wasn't going to work as I originally
   thought. Back to square one...

Finding a clue to the puzzle

   That's when I busted out some Google-Fu and tried to find any hook or
   filter Woocomerce had to directly modify the output of the query. There
   is no Woocommerce-direct way to do this from what I've found. I did
   however find a [12]WordPress support post of people asking a similar
   question, and a guy by the name of bheadrick in that discussion
   provided some sample code.

     This works to sort products by category on the main shop page, but
     it also changes the order of my blog posts AND takes away the
     ability for any other sort of options, which is a bit of a bummer.

   That is the sad key to the great code-snippet he provided in the
   discussion. Although it worked, it modified all of WordPress' post
   queries instead of just the Woocomerce product's page. I decided to dig
   into the Woocomerce code itself.

Reading the code to find an answer

   [13]In classes/class-Wc-Query.php on line 411, I found the function
   that called the woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args filter. Looking
   upwards from that line on 396, is Woocomerce calling a filter
   post_clauses, bingo!

   This is the filter I can use to add clauses (joins, wheres, orders) to
   the $args passed. So mixing that, with the code bheadrick provided in
   the discussion is this...
add_filter('woocommerce_default_catalog_orderby_options', 'ty_catalog_orderby');
add_filter('woocommerce_catalog_orderby', 'ty_catalog_orderby');
function ty_catalog_orderby( $sortby ) {
  $sortby['originals'] = 'Originals';
  $sortby['prints']    = 'Prints';

  return $sortby;
}

add_filter('woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args', 'ty_get_catalog_ordering_arg
s');
function ty_get_catalog_ordering_args($args) {
  global $wpdb;

  $orderby_value = isset($_GET['orderby']) ? woocommerce_clean($_GET['orderby'])
 : apply_filters('woocommerce_default_catalog_orderby', get_option('woocommerce_
default_catalog_orderby'));

  if ('originals' == $orderby_value) {
    $args['orderby']  = 'date';
    $args['order']    = 'DESC';
    $args['meta_key'] = '';

    add_filter('posts_clauses', 'ty_post_clausesdd_originals');
  }

  if ('prints' == $orderby_value) {
    $args['orderby']  = 'date';
    $args['order']    = 'DESC';
    $args['meta_key'] = '';

    add_filter('posts_clauses', 'ty_post_clausesdd_prints');
  }

  return $args;
}

function ty_post_clausesdd_originals($args) {
  global $wpdb;

  $args['join']  .= " JOIN " . $wpdb->term_relationships ." tr ON " . $wpdb->pos
ts . ".id = tr.object_id JOIN " . $wpdb->term_taxonomy ." tt ON tt.term_taxonomy
_id = tr.term_taxonomy_id AND tt.taxonomy = 'product_cat' JOIN " . $wpdb->terms
." t ON tt.term_id = t.term_id
JOIN " . $wpdb->woocommerce_termmeta ." tm ON tm.woocommerce_term_id = t.term_id
 and tm.meta_key = 'order'";
  $args['where'] .= " AND (t.term_id = 13)";

  return $args;
}

function ty_post_clausesdd_prints($args) {
  global $wpdb;

  $args['join']  .= " JOIN " . $wpdb->term_relationships ." tr ON " . $wpdb->pos
ts . ".id = tr.object_id JOIN " . $wpdb->term_taxonomy ." tt ON tt.term_taxonomy
_id = tr.term_taxonomy_id AND tt.taxonomy = 'product_cat' JOIN " . $wpdb->terms
." t ON tt.term_id = t.term_id
JOIN " . $wpdb->woocommerce_termmeta ." tm ON tm.woocommerce_term_id = t.term_id
 and tm.meta_key = 'order'";
  $args['where'] .= " AND (t.term_id = 16)";

  return $args;
}

     * Lines 1-8 register the extra filters I want to show in
       Woocommerce's filter dropdown.
     * Lines 10-33 adds my custom handler for when my filter is selected
       and called.
     * Lines 35-43 and45-53` is where the magic happens.

In conclusion

   Looking at the function ty_get_catalog_ordering_args, I check if my
   filter is being called, and if it is, I register a filter call for
   post_clauses on lines 21 and 29. When the post_clauses are called, it
   will run one of my functions such as ty_post_clausesdd_originals. In
   this function, I add the join provided by bheadrick and add a where
   clause to tell it to find only posts with a category ID of 13. Because
   this filter is being called inside __ty_get_catalog_ordering_args_
   function, it will not affect standard WordPress post listings.

   All you need to do if you wish to add this to your project is to change
   up the titling of the filter names and modify each category ID I
   provided. You can even do multiples by changing it to $args['where'] .=
   " AND t.term_id IN(13, 15, 19)"; if you wish to get products in
   multiple categories for one filter action.

   Anyways, that's my story on the hunt to add such a filter. Feel free to
   modify this and use it in your code since there doesn't seem to be a
   more viable option around that I've seen.
