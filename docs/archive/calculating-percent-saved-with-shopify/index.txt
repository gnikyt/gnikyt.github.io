                     Calculating percent saved with Shopify

   /* Sep 24, 2015 — 2.0KB */

   This post is 9 years old and may contain outdated information.

   Visually displaying to the customer how much they are saving is a big
   help to driving them towards a purchase. This is a simple snippet and
   guide to help you achieve this functionality in your Shopify stores.

   First, to calculate the percentage saved, let’s look at the basic math
   for this in plain text.
percent saved = ((old price - new price) / old price) * 100

   If we were to replace the values with some real numbers we can see the
   result:
((231.99 - 200.00) / 231.99) * 100 = 13.789
A savings of about 14% when rounded up

The Snippet

   Create a new snippet in Shopify called percent-savings.liquid and use
   the following code:
{%-liquid
    assign _compare_price = compare_price | plus: 0.00 %}
    assign _price = price | plus: 0.00 %}
    assign difference = _compare_price | minus: _price %}
    assign percent = difference | divided_by: _compare_price | times: 100 | roun
d %}
    echo percent | append: '%'
-%}

   As an explanation of the code:
     * Lines 1 & 2 we are converting the prices to a float so we can use
       decimal places
     * Line 3 is getting the difference which is simply subtracting the
       new price from the old price
     * Line 4 is dividing the difference by the old price, then
       multiplying it by 100 and then rounding it

Usage

   Pass two parameters to the include tag.
    1. price being the current price of the product
    2. compare_price being the old price of the product.

{% if product.price_min < product.compare_at_price_min %}
  Old price {{ product.compare_at_price_min | money }} &ndash; {% render 'percen
t-savings', price: product.price, compare_price: product.compare_at_price_min %}
 savings!
{% endif %}

   With the above example, if a product was $15.99 and is now $11.99 you
   should see it display:
Old price $15.99 - 25% savings!
