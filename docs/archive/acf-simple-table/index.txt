   I’ve released a new GitHub repo. It’s an add-on for popular [5]ACF
   (Advanced Custom Fields) for WordPress which allows you to create
   really custom post/taxonomy pages and more.

   I ran into an issue with a client a few months back where the client
   needed to enter table data but keep the styling on the front-end
   unchanged. Now, like most clients, getting them to edit the HTML is out
   of the question so I had to come up with a solution to allow him to
   enter his data for the post.

   So I wrote this add-on for ACF. It allows you to set the number of
   rows, columns, and even titles for the client to see. All they need to
   do is enter their data and off you go! You can easily with a few lines
   of code extract it into a usable form (its pretty much just an array
   representing a table).

   To see some screenshots and sample usage of this add-on please [6]click
   here and you’re free to use this in any commercial or personal project!
