                      Get single field error in Symfony /

   /* Dec 12, 2013  —  941B */

   This is just a quick tid-bit/how-to!

   Recently a project came up where special front-end actions and
   structures had to take place within the view of the Twig template once
   an error occurred on specific fields. It also didn’t require enough
   attention to warrant creating a form theme.

   This is a quick way to test if a field has errors; Simply do this
   inside your Twig template…
{% raw %}{{ form.__field_name__.vars.errors|length }}{% endraw %}

   The above code will show how many errors a certain field has. A usage
   example…
{% raw %}
{% if form.__field_name__.vars.errors|length > 0 %}
  <div class="special-class-for-jquery">{{ form_errors(__field_name__) }}</div>
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}

   Just replace field_name with the field name you wish to use!
