Introduction

   I maintain a fairly used [5]PHP library for Shopify API which uses
   Guzzle for sync/async requests. It was also recently featured as a
   recommended third-party library on Shopify’s dev docs.

   For Python, which I also use with Shopify work, I didn’t notice a
   library which provides async abilities. Normally I use Shopify’s Python
   library which provides a nice ActiveResource implementation. However,
   their library has no plans to support async.

   I decided to create a tested library that can do both,
   [6]basic_shopify_api. It is a loose port of my PHP version which
   supports sync, async, HMAC validation, rate limiting, automatic
   retries, REST, and GraphQL; all backed by the HTTPX package.

   You simply need to set up some basic options and create a session for a
   shop to get started.

Sync

REST

from basic_shopify_api import Client

# ...

with Client(sess, opts) as client:
    shop = client.rest("get", "/admin/api/shop.json", {"fields": "name,email"})
    print(shop.response)
    print(shop.body["name"])

    # returns the following:
    # RestResult(
    #   response=The HTTPX response object,
    #   body=A dict of JSON response, or None if errors,
    #   errors=A dict of error response (if possible), or None for no errors, or
 the exception error,
    #   status=The HTTP status code,
    #   link=A RestLink object of next/previous pagination info,
    #   retries=Number of retires for the request
    # )

GraphQL

from basic_shopify_api import Client

# ...

with Client(sess, opts) as client:
    shop = client.graphql("{ shop { name } }")
    print(shop.response)
    print(shop.body["data"]["shop"]["name"])

    # returns the following:
    # ApiResult(
    #   response=The HTTPX response object,
    #   body=A dict of JSON response, or None if errors,
    #   errors=A dict of error response (if possible), or None for no errors, or
 the exception error,
    #   status=The HTTP status code,
    #   retries=Number of retires for the request,
    # )

Async

REST

from basic_shopify_api import AsyncClient

# ...

async with AsyncClient(sess, opts) as client:
    shop = await client.rest("get", "/admin/api/shop.json", {"fields": "name,ema
il"})
    print(shop.response)
    print(shop.body["name"])

    # returns the following:
    # RestResult(
    #   response=The HTTPX response object,
    #   body=A dict of JSON response, or None if errors,
    #   errors=A dict of error response (if possible), or None for no errors, or
 the exception error,
    #   status=The HTTP status code,
    #   link=A RestLink object of next/previous pagination info,
    #   retries=Number of retires for the request
    # )

GraphQL

from basic_shopify_api import AsyncClient

# ...

async with AsyncClient(sess, opts) as client:
    shop = await client.graphql("{ shop { name } }")
    print(shop.response)
    print(shop.body["data"]["shop"]["name"])

    # returns the following:
    # ApiResult(
    #   response=The HTTPX response object,
    #   body=A dict of JSON response, or None if errors,
    #   errors=A dict of error response (if possible), or None for no errors, or
 the exception error,
    #   status=The HTTP status code,
    #   retries=Number of retires for the request,
    # )

Conclusion

   The above examples are brief, refer to the README of the project for
   full information. But I believe you will find it very helpful -
   especially the automatic retries for failed requests and built-in
   rate/cost limiting.

   Feel free to give it a try with your projects, with the continual rise
   of async within Python, I hope the library will serve some use to you.
   I’ve recently paired it with [7]FastAPI and it performed well.
