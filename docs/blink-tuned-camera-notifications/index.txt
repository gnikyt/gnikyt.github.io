                      Blink - Tuned camera notifications /

   /* Nov 28, 2022  —  4.3KB */

   Note: This post is geared towards Android devices. Currently unaware of
   a solution for Apple devices.*

The Problem

   If you have a Blink setup at work or home, you’ve probably run into a
   common issue of getting notifications for cameras which you do not care
   to have notifications for. For example, you may have six cameras
   recording motion, but you may only care about receiving notifications
   for two of them; but with Blink’s app, there is no way to control this.

   It’s all or nothing with Blink. This is because (at time of writing),
   Blink uses a single channel to push notifications to called Motion
   detection. Because of this, you are unable to silence notifications for
   specific cameras, you only have the option of silencing the whole
   notification channel, which would leave you without any motion
   notifications to your device.

Solutions

Snoozing

   Since an update earlier this year, Amazon has added a snooze feature
   displayed as an icon next to each camera’s name.

   Clicking the icon will give you options to snooze notifications for 1,
   2, 3, or 4 hours.

   This seemed like a viable solution on the surface, but in practice, it
   fails. Even with selecting 4 hours, it appears to be bugged… I would
   get notifications just 20 minutes later, but the snooze icon would
   still be active. Additionally, repeating this action for every camera,
   every 4 hours, was a little annoying.

   Given it was buggy and was not automated, I abandoned this as a
   solution. Plus, why couldn’t Amazon add a “Until I turn off” option to
   the list of times? That would be an ideal built-in solution.

Macrodroid

   I previously installed an app called [3]Macrodroid, for automating some
   “Do Not Disturb” rules.

   Macrodroid is similar to the popular Tasker app for Android. These are
   apps which allow you to automate your phone based on triggers or
   actions performed.

   In digging more into the offered triggers for Macrodroid, I discovered
   it had a feature to read notifications instantly and perform an action
   on them.

   With some trial and error, I was able to build a macro in the app which
   would watch for a notification containing the camera names, and then
   running an action to clear those notifications.

   It worked! The instant a notification comes in for one of the cameras I
   wish to ignore notifications for, it clears it out so I never have to
   see or hear it.

Setup

    1. Install Macrodroid
    2. Go through the setup and enable the correct permissions for app
       overlays, notification access, etc.
    3. Click Add Macro
    4. In the Triggers panel, click the + icon
    5. From the list, select Notifications
    6. Select Notification Received for the event option
    7. Select Select Applications(s) then choose Blink from the list
    8. Set for text contains to be:

     * Motion detected at your [CAMERA_NAME]
     * Replace [CAMERA NAME] with the camera’s name
     * Example: Motion detected at your Porch

    9. Save, then in the Actions panel, click the + icon
   10. Select Notification from the list
   11. Select Clear Notifications from the secondary list
   12. Select Select Application(s) then choose Blink from the list
   13. Set for text contains to be:

     * Motion detected at your [CAMERA_NAME]
     * Replace [CAMERA NAME] with the camera’s name
     * Example: Motion detected at your Porch

   14. Check off Ignore ongoing notifications
   15. Save, then save the macro with a desired name

Result

   Once configured, your macro should be similar to this:
   Macro Macro

   You can additionally use regular expressions on the text contains input
   to apply it to multiple camera names, or you can duplicate the macro
   and change the text contains for each camera… both options work fine in
   my testing.

Conclusion

   Until Amazon adds the ability to snooze notifications indefinitely or
   adds notification channels per camera, then the best option is to take
   advantage of Macrodroid. With the macro, you will no longer receive
   notifications for those specific cameras, but still allow them to stay
   enabled and record motion.
