Purpose

   There are many lengthy guides out there for the official Docker image
   for WordPress. However, some people have a little trouble getting going
   so I will quickly provide some tips to help out.

   I haven’t used WordPress professionally in a long time, but I decided
   to do some weekend digging to keep my brain fresh, so forgive any
   errors ;)

Setup

Directories

   Let’s create a basic directory structure to use. Keep in mind, this is
   geared for theme development.
     * {your_theme}/
          + wordpress/
               o wp-content/
                    # themes/
                         @ (your-theme)/
                    # uploads/

   We only need to track our theme, so we do not need to install the whole
   WordPress system.

   Once done, be sure to chmod 755 wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ so
   WordPress can write to this directory when uploading media.

Docker

   Next, let’s get Docker ready. The simplest way is to use a [5]Docker
   Compose file. It’s a simple YML-formatted file that’s easy to read for
   anyone.

   Based on [6]WordPress’ Offical Image, I’ve compiled the following
   docker-compose.yml [7]file you can use.

   Simply replace {YOUR_THEME} with your theme name and save it to the
   root of {your_theme}/ directory.

Volumes

   In the docker-compose.yml file you’ll notice two entries under volumes.

   One maps the theme folder to the WordPress install so it’s visible to
   WordPress, the other maps, read-write, wp-content/uploads to the
   WordPress install as well so it can write and read media from a
   location accessible.

Git Ignore

   Now that you have the directories set up, Docker Compose ready, volumes
   mapped… its time to setup Git.

   wordpress/wp-content/uploads/*

   Now, we keep track of only our theme.

Running

   Once you’re done the quick setup simply run docker-compose up in the
   main directory. On the first run, you’ll have to run through the
   WordPress installation process.

   After it’s done, simply log in and visit Appearance. If you have your
   theme setup as per WordPress requirements (style.css (with info) and
   index.php) then you will see it in the theme list. Hit “Activate” and
   you’re ready to go.

Windows (WSL1) Tips

   If you’re running this under WSL1, be sure you have Docker on Windows
   settings set to expose Docker daemon without TLS (it’s under General
   panel).

   Also, WSL1 accesses your C: drive via /mnt/c but Docker requires /c. To
   resolve this issue simply create a symlink via ln -s /mnt/c /c. If this
   is not done, you’ll have issues with Docker under WSL trying to find
   files and map volumes. This means you also need to run docker-compose
   commands under /c as well.

   To quickly switch to /c no matter what directory you’re under, open
   $HOME/.bash_aliases and add this entry:
alias cswap='cd `pwd | sed 's,/mnt,,g'`'

   Now, any directory you’re in, simply run cswap and it’ll move you to /c
tyler@bash[/mnt/c/Users/Tyler/Development/GitHub/wordpress-docker-setup/]$ cswap
tyler@bash[/c/Users/Tyler/Development/GitHub/wordpress-docker-setup/]$ docker-co
mpose up
Starting...

Further Exploring

   [8]I’ve set up a repo on Github which contains all I’ve talked about
   above plus some extras like a basic Grunt setup for managing asset
   files. Feel free to clone, run docker-compose up, and play around!

   I hope this has helped anyone struggling.
