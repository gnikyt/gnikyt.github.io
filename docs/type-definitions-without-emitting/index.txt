Introduction

   A Shopify-based project was assigned which was a backend app with
   frontend extensions. After completion of the backend, it was realized
   that the frontend extensions needed types from the backend.

   Extensions with Shopify’s setup does not allow importing relative
   packages. For example, if this was the loose structure:
 - app/
     - paginate/
         index.ts
         index.test.ts
     - value/
         amount.ts
         amount.test.ts
         id.ts
         id.test.ts
     - [etc]
 - extensions/
     - order-stats/
         - src/
            BlockExtension.tsx
         - [etc]
 - [etc]

   We would not be able to do something such as:
// extensions/order-stats/src/BlockExtension.tsx

import { type PaginatedRecords } from "../../../app/paginate";
import { type ShopifyOrderIdValue } from "../../../app/value/id";

   This would produce an error and not compile. You could copy/paste the
   type definitions into the extension manually, but this is not a great
   idea.. what if the types you’re importing change? They would be out of
   sync if you did not manually correct it.

   A solution is to generate types based upon the app into a local package
   which the extensions can use.

types package

   Create a directory at the root called types, then cd inside and run npm
   init. Once done, you should have a package.json inside similar to this:
{
  "name": "app-types",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

   In my case, I named the package app-types, but you’re free to name as
   you please.

Generation

   Create a bin/app-typegen with the following contents:
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# List the files you would like to generate types for
srcs=("paginate/index" "value/id", "value/amount")
for src in "${srcs[@]}"; do
  # Generation to the types/ directory
  tsc -d "app/$src.ts" --declarationDir types
  # Remove Typescript-generated .js files
  for file in $(git status -s); do
    if [[ $file == *"app/"* ]] && [[ $file == *".js"* ]]; then
      rm "$file"
    fi
  done
done

   What this script does is allow you to list out the files you would like
   to generate types for. It will then utilize tsc to generate the types
   and dump the d.ts files into the types directory we previously created.
   Next, it will check the status of git to remove the generated
   Javascript files as there appears to be no way to not emit Javascript
   files during generation.

   Additionally, you can add a slot into your root package.json scripts:
"generate:app-types": "bin/app-typegen"

   Then, you can simply run npm run generate:app-types manually or with
   your CI setup to (re)generate the types.

Importing

   Modify the package.json for the package you would like to use the
   types. In my case, extensions/order-stats/package.json.

   Adding, "app-types": "file:../../../types" to devDependencies, then
   running npm install.

   Now, you’ll be able to import the types without compilation errors or
   warnings as such:
// extensions/order-stats/src/BlockExtension.tsx

import { type PaginatedRecords } from "app-types/paginate/index";
import { type ShopifyOrderIdValue } from "app-types/value/id";
