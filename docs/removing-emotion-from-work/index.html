                I’ve been doing development for about 25 years now, which is still wild to think about. So much has
                changed in that time, <em>like I touched on in my previous article, <a href="/the-lost-web">The lost
                web</a></em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                I honestly think I entered the age of the internet at the perfect time. You had no choice but to do the
                hard work and learn, whether that meant building table layouts in GoLive, wiring some animated
                pill-button form to <code>FormMail.pl</code> in a CGI/Perl setup, adding hit counters and guestbooks to
                every site, fighting JavaScript differences between IE and Netscape, or trying to get your work hosted
                on some shared FTP/cPanel box, tinkering with the hot-new Python, and so on.
              </p>

              <p>
                There weren’t many resources besides literal books in the house, and if you were lucky, an early forum
                where you could ask questions. No AI, no StackOverflow, no Slack or Discord, no smartphones, no instant
                internet access <em>(I still miss the dial-up sound)</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                I fully believe that mix of loving the internet, building things, and grinding through self-taught
                learning made me who I am today. I loved how I could have a vision for something, build it myself, and
                see it working, on <em>the internets</em>. It gave me real-world experience in the trenches: making
                things work, fixing bugs, shipping code. It led me through different roles where I gained even more
                experience. I went from hobbyist, to lead, to leading multiple teams, to helping run an agency, to a
                consultant, to becoming a key pivot in other businesses, and eventually being able to provide for my
                family from what started as a hobby in my dad’s basement on dial-up with the timeless Mac OS 9.
              </p>

              <p>
                But all that experience isn’t just development experience. People management (not “managing people”) is
                a huge factor that separates a hobbyist or junior from a leader. People are far more complex than code,
                easily. Learning how to understand people opens a lot of doors and gives you a lot more peace in your
                work. <em>People</em> can mean a lot of things: employees, co-workers, clients, vendors, merchants. If
                you can get better at people management, you build a better version of yourself, better direction, and
                better harmony around you.
              </p>

              <p>
                A lot of this comes from what we do best as developers: logic. If you can regulate your emotional
                response to an issue, you can see the problem from different perspectives and attack it in a pragmatic,
                logical way <em>(like code)</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                I’m not saying become <em>emotionless</em>. Empathy is critical… it’s how you understand why a client
                is spiraling or why a teammate may be difficult. The goal isn’t to remove emotion, it’s to manage it.
                Keep your own reactions in check while staying attuned to the emotional state of the room.
              </p>

              <p>
                We all know clients get angry sometimes. Sometimes they take it out on you. But if you step back,
                regulate your response, and look at the context, you’ll often see it’s not really about you personally.
                They might be under pressure from a production issue, working late, stressed, and reacting… and
                unfortunately, you are the one they react <em>to</em>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sometimes, the other person needs to feel heard before they can engage logically. Jumping straight into
                problem-solving mode too early can actually escalate things. Let them vent, acknowledge the
                frustration, then guide the conversation toward resolution.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you respond emotionally, that’s not productive… it usually makes things worse. If you treat it like
                a personal attack, that’s not productive either, because now you’re focused on being defensive instead
                of solving the problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                But if you regulate your own emotions and treat the situation like a logical problem <em>(like
                code)</em>, you can navigate the conversation calmly and move toward a real solution without being
                reactive.
              </p>

              <p>
                The same goes for co-workers, employees, your team… whoever it is. People are complex, and people are
                emotional. When pressure ramps up, emotions bubble up and often come out the wrong way.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the end of the day, whether it’s a code issue or an internal people issue, emotion doesn’t need to
                drive the response.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Nobody wants more conflict. Everyone wants resolution.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                Resolution comes faster when you think clearly and logically.
              </p>

              <p>
                I’ve been that guy getting screamed at over the phone by a client in front of a board while fixing a
                production issue I didn’t cause. I’ve been inside internal team conflict. I’ve been thrown under the
                bus. But! I’ve handled those situations well by keeping my own emotions regulated, and I’ve come out of
                those situations with mature and sensible resolutions because I focused on the problem while still
                acknowledging the human side of it all. It’s more productive and it makes you look professionally
                mature.
              </p>

              <p>
                So in the end, all this time I’ve been developing, I’ve been building two skill sets: coding, and
                people. That second one has helped separate me from others and keep me effective as a problem solver,
                whether the problem is code or people.
              </p>

              <p>
                Regulating emotion in your work doesn’t make you cold. It makes you clearer. Stay attuned to the room,
                stay empathetic, but don’t let your own reactions drive the conversation or influence the potential
                resolution. That balance can make you both a better developer and a better person.
