   Headshot Headshot

   Hello World. I'm Ty(ler) King -- A self-taught, seasoned, and versatile
   developer out of Newfoundland. With over a decade of experience in the
   Shopify ecosystem, I have developed a passion for ecommerce-focused
   initiatives. I specialize in crafting innovative solutions with
   precision and expertise through hands-on coding or consulting.

   Beyond development, I bring extensive expertise in process development
   and consulting, along with a proven track record in team leadership,
   talent acquisition, and organizational growth. My experience and
   open-door mindset allow me to navigate both the technical and human
   sides of business with confidence.

   You can reach me several ways -- through [9]me@gnikyt.com, with
   [10]Github, or connect on [11]LinkedIn.
