_Hello World_. I'm **Ty(ler) King** â€” A self-taught, seasoned, and versatile developer out of Newfoundland. With over a decade of experience in the Shopify ecosystem, I have developed a passion for ecommerce-focused initiatives. I specialize in crafting innovative solutions with precision and expertise through hands-on coding or consulting.

Beyond development, I bring extensive expertise in process development and consulting, along with a proven track record in team leadership, talent acquisition, and organizational growth. My experience and open-door mindset allow me to navigate both the technical and human sides of business with confidence.

You can reach me several ways &mdash; through [me@gnikyt.com](mailto:me@gnikyt.com), with [Github](https://github.com/gnikyt), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gnikyt).
