                  Laravel Shopify featured on Shopify Dev Blog

   Mar 04, 2021

   A couple of weeks ago, Liam Griffin at Shopify reached out to me about
   the Laravel Shopify package, interested in featuring it on Shopifyʼs
   development blog with other community-built tools.

   You can view the article [3]here at Shopifyʼs blog, Laravel Shopify is
   the second mentioned package.

   Thank you Liam for the opportunity to share the package with your
   readers!
