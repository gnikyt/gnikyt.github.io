   A couple of weeks ago, Liam Griffin at Shopify reached out to me about
   the Laravel Shopify package, interested in featuring it on Shopify’s
   development blog with other community-built tools.

   You can view the article [12]here at Shopify’s blog, Laravel Shopify is
   the second mentioned package.

     This is a Laravel package that integrates with Shopify’s REST and
     GraphQL APIs, and assists developers working with PHP in their apps.
     Laravel is an increasingly popular framework for PHP, and this
     package is compatible with version 7 and above of Laravel.

     “[…] we’ve used the package for a wide variety of clients to meet
     their custom requirements,” says Tyler King. “We’ve used it to
     create apps that manage flash ticket sales, loyalty rewards
     programs, and more. The package has allowed us to get from concept
     to minimal implementation within a day, in some cases.”

     King also adopted Polaris and GraphQL into the package when Shopify
     released these features, so both developers and users can feel at
     home with a consistent interface throughout the Shopify Admin
     experience.

     In 2017, King open-sourced the package on Github without any
     expectations of adoption.

     “I simply put it out there in hopes someone would find it as useful
     as I did. I guess the timing was right for opening it up to the
     world because it quickly gained traction, growth, and contributors,
     evolving into what it is today.”

   Thank you Liam for the opportunity to share the package with your
   readers!
