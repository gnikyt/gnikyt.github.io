                                   Go is nice

   /* Apr 22, 2019 — 1.9KB */

   I’ve been coding with Golang in my spare time for the past year. It’s
   been different from the regular day-to-day Python, PHP, and Typescript.

   I’ve released a few side projects such as a [3]simple blockchain
   implementation, a [4]webhook validator for Shopify, a [5]Python clone
   of with, and [6]other nick-nacks. Unfortunately, I haven’t had the
   chance to use it a whole lot during working hours.

   Go is a strange beast. To a newcomer, it has an odd syntax for methods,
   loops, doesn’t come with built-in collection methods, its plain-jane
   control flow, and to top it off.. it is not functional and it is not
   object-oriented.

   I won’t get into depths of Go, but I just wanted to shout out to its
   beauty in its strangeness in this post. It allows you to code freely in
   a logical manner, with the power of interfaces and structs that I’ve
   not yet seen in another language I’ve personally worked with.

   I love how it also does not hold your hand. You’re free to do what you
   please and it is very bare-bones in a sense which gives you a good base
   to build from (example: the built-in testing package has no
   assertions). Its also hella fast.. the compile times and plain
   processing abilities are phenomenal.

   There’s a lot of built-in tools like gofmt which ensures your code is
   formatted a certain way and the build system, the ability to build
   targetted binaries for systems (even exes!) quickly.

   The community is growing rapidly and many tools are popping up, and
   many tools are being rewritten to Go. I’m excited to see its future and
   continue working with it more, hopefully, the next few versions will
   fix some module issues and introduce generics.
