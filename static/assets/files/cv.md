### Programming Values

I adhere to the principle of simplicity and focus in all of my code. Each component should serve a single, well-defined purpose to ensure clarity and maintainability. This approach leads to a stable and scalable codebase that can evolve over time. I consistently apply best practices such as the SRP/DRY principles, CQR Segregation, and more to achieve this objective. As well, I believe in always learning and listening - self improvement crafts better code.
