<p>You might think, <em>&quot;Why are you trying to develop on Windows? Why not use OSX or (insert Linux distro)&quot;</em>. Its because I'm preparing for a stable future. With the decisions of Apple the past year with the iPhone and new Macbook, I no longer like the direction the company is taking. I won't go into depth, but the entire lineup is a laughing stock to be honest. I will no longer be continuing with Apple for my next upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>I decided to run an experiment to see if I could survive on Windows for my development needs.</strong></p>
<h2 id="whywindows">Why Windows?</h2>
<p>I used Linux on/off for close to 15 years now. Don't get me wrong, I <strong>love</strong> Linux, I always will. I don't care how many people say otherwise, its software support for many apps lack compared to the Windows/Mac version. Many people will say, <em>&quot;So switch to using (insert some different standard or app not many people use)&quot;</em>, its not that easy especially in the business world. I can't just tell all my co-workers to start using random apps that have little backing. Theres a suite of software I require daily which many do not work or lack proper implementation in Linux… and I'm not talking about the Adobe suite.</p>
<p>Apps in Windows normally get first-class implementation — it just works. This is something important to me. I don't want to fix issues daily, I want to work. With OSX out of the picture, Windows was the next best thing for me that would <em>just work</em> and keep me <em>productive</em> in my mind.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p><em>One warning about this post... I used Windows on my MacBook via Bootcamp. I feel its not the proper experience I could get out of Windows if I used a proper Windows laptop for work (XPS, Thinkpad, etc). I'll note more later why I say I did not get a proper experience.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Model</em>: 2014 Macbook Pro Retina</li>
<li><em>RAM</em>: 8GB</li>
<li><em>Space:</em> 256GB SSD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: 10 — Home Edition</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setupjourney">Setup Journey</h2>
<h3 id="virtualmachining">Virtual Machining</h3>
<p>Development on Windows is a mess. If anyone's ever done Ruby, Python, etc, development on a Windows machine, its usually a hit or miss. You run into issues with libs, compiling, support, mystic errors, and a pile of workarounds. A lot of people try to get around some issues by using tools like <strong><a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a></strong>, or some other shell implementation but they still run into issues.I wanted to avoid all these issues by essentially taking Windows out of the equation.</p>
<p>To do this, I decided to run Linux in a VM and host all my development needs in the VM. Now I have a clear separation. I can have the stability of Windows with all my required apps, and have my development… both in their own worlds.</p>
<p>I decided to use <strong>VMWare Player</strong> and install <strong><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS</a></strong>. I chose Ubuntu over something like Arch simply for time-sake of my experiment. From what I read, Ubuntu and VMWare have perfect support for one another. I require no desktop experience... simply a VM I can &quot;talk&quot; to, so something minimal like the Ubuntu Server was a good fit. I chose the fast install offered by VMWare Player and I had a working VM within 5 minutes.</p>
<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>
<p>Initially I assumed this would eat a lot of my resources. I was wrong.</p>
<p>Post-boot, just idling, VMWare Player and the VM instance itself totalled to ~45mb of RAM in-use. The CPU was negligible as well. Even during a intensive process in the VM, the CPU only reached 21% and RAM didn't increase by much.</p>
<p>So my system was chugging a long happily, the VM didn't seem to affect my computers performance one bit from what I could tell.</p>
<h3 id="vmcommunicationssh">VM Communication &amp; SSH</h3>
<p>I did not want to use the windowed experience of VMWare. I decided I just need to SSH into the VM itself. I enabled <strong>bridged networking</strong> mode in VMWare. This gave the VM its own LAN IP address. Example, if my MacBook was 192.168.2.11 my VM could be assigned 192.168.2.13. I installed a SSH server on the VM and set it up to work for my needs. I now had a way to talk to the VM.</p>
<h4 id="choosingasshclient">Choosing a SSH client</h4>
<p>I regularly SSH into servers during my week to perform tasks, I also needed to (obviously) SSH into my VM. I looked over many options for Windows… <strong><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://kitty.9bis.net/">Kitty</a></strong> (fork of Putty), <strong><a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I found Putty/Kitty to be great for customizations… its fully-loaded, although confusing interface, provides all anyone could need. It however lacked a single-window/tabbed mode or sub-connections as far as I could tell.</p>
<p>MobaXterm, although great, I found it to be a bit of bloat… I need a terminal and nothing else. It seemed geared towards a more full-featured implementation with support for X11 apps, FTP, text editing, etc.</p>
<p>In the end... I landed on <strong><a href="http://smartty.sysprogs.com/">SmarTTY</a></strong>. An app I discovered while surfing Reddit for suggestions. It provided me with good configuration options, tabbed interface, sub-connections, lightweight, and more.</p>
<h4 id="testingconnections">Testing Connections</h4>
<p>I created an SSH key on the Windows side using Putty's keygen. I plugged the SSH key into the VM and fired up SmarTTY. I created a connection using my username, keyfile, and the VM's IP address.</p>
<p>It connected perfectly. I ran 4 sub-connections to the VM without issue. There was no lag in typing and input to the VM, I was pleased.</p>
<h2 id="postsetup">Post Setup</h2>
<p>So I now had a working, communicable, VM to host my development needs. I went ahead and setup all the tools I needed in the VM (RVM, Python, Go, MySQL, SQLite, Node, etc). On the Windows side I installed <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>/<a href="http://www.sql-workbench.net/">SQL Workbench</a>, <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>, and other tools.</p>
<p>Workflow-wise — I'm happy. I'd edit my files in Atom, have my sessions opened in SmarTTY watching files (for Grunt or Rails, etc), edit my databases with workbench. Everything seemed to work fine without a hitch.</p>
<p>Although the setup took a bit a time, I believe its a great path to take given Bash for Windows, is not fully ready yet for use. I actually, surprisingly found the Windows install to be snappier than OSX… I suspect thats due to it being a new install however. The battery-life was on-par with OSX despite what I heard online of Windows draining MacBook batteries in no-time.</p>
<p>Overall I was happy with the Windows experience as a whole. Both as a developer and a PC user.</p>
<h3 id="miscissues">Misc. Issues</h3>
<p>Although the setup was fine, I was slightly hindered by not using a laptop designed for Windows in mind as I mentioned previously.</p>
<h4 id="1keyboard">1. Keyboard</h4>
<p>A few text-flow issues I ran into that I normally do on Mac such as deleting a whole line of text was not possible because the MacBook keyboard is missing a few keys for this that Windows targets.</p>
<p>The position of the CTRL button was also slightly farther away than I liked. I found I had to change my natural posture for using CTRL functions due the spacing for cutting, copying, pasting, etc.</p>
<h4 id="2mousetrackpad">2. Mouse &amp; Trackpad</h4>
<p>Bootcamp installs drivers to emulate the trackpad a mouse. Tap emulates a click, two finger emulates a right click, and there is no trackpad gestures likes dragging built-in. Changing the sensitivity of the scrolling with the trackpad would result in the mouse having the same scrolling sensitivity and one would be slower than the other. I found a great app to get around the issue, called <strong><a href="http://eithermouse.com">EitherMouse</a></strong>. It detects individual devices and allows you to assign settings for each. This solved my issue on that part.</p>
<p>I suspect if I owned a Thinkpad, XPS, Zenbook, or some other Windows-designed laptop, I would have a much better experience.</p>
<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>
<p>I'll have my current MacBook and iPhone for a couple years to come but my next upgrade in the future will move away from this company. This experience was a good lesson that yes, I can develop in Windows just fine, without any drawbacks that I can see to my flow. This will heavily weigh my decision for purchases in the future.</p>
